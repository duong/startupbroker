<h1>Business Broker Lexicon</h1>
<dl>
<dt><dfn>Asset Deal</dfn></dt>
<dd>Company takeover by way of acquisition of certain assets (instead of the shares). In contrast to this is the Share Deal.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Asset Stripping</dfn></dt>
<dd>Sale of assets or sub-areas of an acquired company immediately after its acquisition. Typical motives are either the financing of the purchase price or the opportunity that the total value can be raised through the sale of individual parts. However, the tax consequences should be taken into account.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Assets</dfn></dt>
<dd>A company&#39;s Assets are the sum of all factors of production required by the company in cash, all their rights (e.g. patents, licenses) and material resources (e.g. raw materials, machinery, buildings, land). A distinction must be made between fixed assets and current assets.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Assets ratio 1</dfn></dt>
<dd>Provides information about how high the equity is in the ratio of fixed assets.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Assets ratio 2</dfn></dt>
<dd>Provides information about how high the equity is plus the long-term debt in the ratio of fixed assets.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Averaging Method</dfn></dt>
<dd>The term Averaging Method covers several methods of business valuation. Here, the yield value and the intrinsic value of a company are recorded. The determination of the value of the company is carried out in different ways with a different but fixed weighting of the values in the averaging. In Switzerland, the profitability is used twice and the asset value is used once to calculate the value of the company. The Stuttgart-based method uses the profitability once and the asset value twice for the calculation. The Berlin-based methods both values weighted equally</dd>
<dt><dfn>Benchmark</dfn></dt>
<dd>Benchmarking refers to the comparison of the performance of one&rsquo;s own company with that of other companies. The performance counter of the other company is known as a Benchmark. The aim of such a comparison is to uncover opportunities for improvement and competitive disadvantages and ultimately to increase the performance of one&rsquo;s own company.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Break-even-Point</dfn></dt>
<dd>Time when the breakeven point is exceeded and a profit is realized or the level of revenue, which would cover the proceeds of the fixed and variable costs.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Bridge Financing</dfn></dt>
<dd>Bridge financing is a generic term made by credit institutions for short-term or intermediate pre-financing of certain transactions (real estate purchase, company purchase) until the final follow-up financing.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Burn Rate</dfn></dt>
<dd>Represents the time until a company has used the capital provided for it (the term originated during the Internet bubble at the turn of the millennium). The Burn Rate is of great importance particularly for start-up companies. The company&#39;s financial resources decrease in the initial phase of the company because of high fixed costs with only a low turnover.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Business Angel</dfn></dt>
<dd>A wealthy individual (usually experienced entrepreneurs) who support young companies with capital as they are founded and/or through active support (coaching or management assistance) and contacts (they are rewarded through shareholdings in the company).</dd>
<dt><dfn>Business plan</dfn></dt>
<dd>A description of the business model of a young company to present to investors, this includes information about product concept, market, team, management of future operations and economic analyses, etc.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Buy-and-build Strategy</dfn></dt>
<dd>The acquisition of several companies in order to build a larger group/holding company.</dd>
<dt><dfn>CAGR</dfn></dt>
<dd>Stands for Compound Annual Growth Rate. A growth rate is defined as the average relative increase of a variable per unit of time.</dd>
<dt><dfn>CAPEX</dfn></dt>
<dd>The abbreviation CAPEX comes from the Anglo-Saxon term of Capital Expenditure. This term refers to the long-term assets of a company such as machinery, buildings or computer systems.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Cash Flow</dfn></dt>
<dd>The Cash Flow from operating activities (Operating Cash Flow) includes all deposits and payments associated with the actual provision of services of the company. Examples are the sale of products or the payment of wages. The Cash Flow from investment activities (Cash Flow from Investment) consists of the deposits and withdrawals, which result from the investment or disinvestment of the company. Examples include the installation of a new production facility or the sale of a warehouse. The Cash Flow from financing activities (Cash Flow from Financing) includes all those deposits and withdrawals, which are related to the financing of business activities. Examples include interest payments or the payment of dividends, but also a borrowing or capital repayment.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Cash Flow Deal</dfn></dt>
<dd>Traditional form of the Management Buyout (MBO), which is financed largely on the basis of the generated cash of a company. Key variable is the Cash Flow from which the return of the funds received and the service rate must be settled.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Cash Ratio</dfn></dt>
<dd>Corresponds to the Quick Ratio. It is the ratio of liquid assets to the current liabilities of a company and therefore allows an analysis of how a company can meet its current short-term payment obligations solely by its liquid assets. Accounts receivable (debtors) are not included.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Cash Value</dfn></dt>
<dd>The cash value or present value of the item refers to the expected value of a future cash amount. The cash value is obtained by discounting the future cash equivalent amount, with a capital interest, the expression of an alternative achievable interest rate.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Chief Executive Officer (CEO)</dfn></dt>
<dd>Chief Executive Officer</dd>
<dt><dfn>Chief Financial Officer (CFO)</dfn></dt>
<dd>Chief Financial Officer</dd>
<dt><dfn>Chief Organisation Officer (COO)</dfn></dt>
<dd>Chief Organisation Officer</dd>
<dt><dfn>Chief Technological Officer (CTO)</dfn></dt>
<dd>Chief Technological Officer</dd>
<dt><dfn>Co-Investment</dfn></dt>
<dd>Stake in a company with a minority share, whereby the support is given through a Lead Investor and thus reduces the support costs for the Co-Investor.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Co-Lead Investments</dfn></dt>
<dd>Stake in a company at the same level as that of the Lead Investor. The latter assumes the true support of the investee.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Collection Period</dfn></dt>
<dd>The accounts receivable period provides information on the time it takes the customer to make payments. It corresponds to the time between invoicing and payment by the customer. The higher the retention time of the debtor company, the slower the payment, the less favourable the liquidity.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Confidentiality Agreement</dfn></dt>
<dd>Also Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA). Usually agreed on during the transfer of business plans and company presentations to third parties. The prospective buyer agrees that he will not share information with third parties.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Consortium</dfn></dt>
<dd>Group of all supervising banks in the IPO.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Consortium Leader</dfn></dt>
<dd>Leading bank in the IPO of a company.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Contribution Margin</dfn></dt>
<dd>The contribution margin is the cost and performance calculation, the difference between the proceeds generated (revenue) and the variable costs. It is therefore the amount available to cover fixed costs.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Co-Venturing</dfn></dt>
<dd>Stake in a company by several investors, one of whom acts as the Lead Investor.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Current Ratio</dfn></dt>
<dd>Corresponds to the current ratio. It indicates the ratio of current assets to the current liabilities of a company. If the current ratio is less than 1, a part of current liabilities is not covered by the current assets, i.e. under certain circumstances assets must be sold to cover liabilities. Therefore, this liquidity ratio must always be greater than 1, whereby one should aim according to the so-called &quot;banker&#39;s rule&quot; (also known as Two-to-One-Rule) for a minimum value of 2.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Debt Ratio</dfn></dt>
<dd>The Debt Ratio is the proportion of debt to total capital and total assets analogous to the equity ratio of the equity.<br />
This key figure indicates the ratio between debt and equity. The higher the debt, the higher the debt ratio.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Deferred Taxes</dfn></dt>
<dd>Hidden tax charges or benefits that have arisen due to differences in approach and / or the valuation of assets and liabilities between the tax accounts and the trade balance and are expected to reduce in subsequent years, i.e. to lead to differences in the future between tax and perform trade-balance-sheet profits. Deferred tax assets should reflect the future tax benefits (future tax higher income potential) future tax expense, deferred tax liabilities (future tax higher yield potential).</dd>
<dt><dfn>Dilution</dfn></dt>
<dd>When a company issues additional shares at a lower price in the context of a capital increase and the existing shareholders do not participate according to their current share, the shares of existing shareholders lose value, they are diluted.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Discounted-Cash-Flow Method</dfn></dt>
<dd>The possibility of determining the value of the company. Calculated on the basis of the discounted future Cash Flow over a certain period of time. The basis is the projected Free Cash Flow and a residual value that will be discounted to their present values.<br />
In this method, the assets are allocated with an operational importance, namely the achievement of future income. The method assumes that the assets of the company generate a constant perpetuity of sustainable net profits. The capitalization of this income is calculated using the formula for eternal pensions of future earnings divided by the discount rate.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Early Stage (Financing)</dfn></dt>
<dd>Financing in the first phase of young, privately owned companies with equity. Usually, specialized companies (venture capital firms) offer the Early-Stage financing. These companies often offer other services besides the financing for start-up companies such as consulting activities and regular monitoring of the overall activity of the company. This funding is often associated with great risk, but offers large profit potential in the event of a subsequent success of the new company.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Earn-out</dfn></dt>
<dd>The portion of a company purchase price, which is conditional on the future success of the company. A key figure, usually the turnover, is defined for the compensation of the remaining company purchase price. A percentage of sales is determined to repay the purchase price.</dd>
<dt><dfn>EBIT</dfn></dt>
<dd>Earnings before interest and taxes.</dd>
<dt><dfn>EBIT Margin</dfn></dt>
<dd>A company&#39;s key figure that indicates the ratio of EBIT to sales as a percentage. It is particularly suitable for comparing the performance of different companies.</dd>
<dt><dfn>EBITDA</dfn></dt>
<dd>Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.</dd>
<dt><dfn>EBITDA Margin</dfn></dt>
<dd>The EBITDA margin is calculated from the ratio of the EBITDA to sales as a percentage. It is suitable for comparing the operating performance of different companies, regardless of their investment cycle.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Economic Value Added (EVA)</dfn></dt>
<dd>Key figure, which is used in a comprehensive performance measurement and value. The Economic Value-Added-Value approach calculates the residual income of the investment being valued. An investment will create value in accordance with this approach if it generates a positive &quot;spread&quot; (difference) between the actual return and the demanded cost of capital.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Employee stock options</dfn></dt>
<dd>Form of employee participation. The right to acquire shares or options on shares of your company at a discounted price after a specified waiting period.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Entity Method</dfn></dt>
<dd>A variant of the Discounted-Cash-Flow valuation method based on total capital, with which the gross value of the company is determined. First, a detailed Free Cash Flow is drawn up over a period of five to ten years. These gross quantities are then discounted with the WACC. In order to obtain the effective value of equity, the borrowed capital must be subtracted.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Equity</dfn></dt>
<dd>Equity</dd>
<dt><dfn>Equity Kicker</dfn></dt>
<dd>Equity Kicker means the possibility of sharing in the company&#39;s success. This may, for example, be in the conversion of Mezzanine Capital into equity, i.e. a &quot;real&quot; participation. Equity stakes are also conceivable for a desired future IPO. Outside investors are thus given the opportunity to purchase shares in partnerships or corporations at a later date, often at special rates.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Equity Ratio</dfn></dt>
<dd>The equity ratio indicates the proportion of economic equity to the adjusted total assets of a company. The higher the ratio, the lower the debt ratio.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Equity Story</dfn></dt>
<dd>Documentation as part of an emission process, in which the essential characteristics of the company and its planned corporate strategy are shown (the success of the company, in the past and in the future).</dd>
<dt><dfn>Equity-Method</dfn></dt>
<dd>A variant of the Discounted-Cash-Flow valuation method that directly determines the value of equity. First, a detailed planning of cash flow over a period of five to ten years. The interest and the growth rate of the debt are to be deducted from this. These net variables are then discounted with the cost of equity, which then gives the value of equity.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Excess profit method</dfn></dt>
<dd>A traditional method of business valuation, where the company&#39;s value is determined using the profits. Profit is meant to denote that which is attained over the normal return of the asset value.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Executive Summary</dfn></dt>
<dd>Summary of, for example, a business plan.</dd>
<dt><dfn>Exit</dfn></dt>
<dd>Withdrawal from a capital investment. Whoever makes capital available to start-up companies, shall sell off his interest after a certain time in the company that has meantime become established, because this no longer lies in his capital focus. A withdrawal may be via an IPO or a sale to another company. This process is known as an Exit Strategy, because the intention is to realize a profit from the investment made.</dd>
