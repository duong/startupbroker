Our default theme for 2017 works great in many languages, on any device, and for a wide range of users.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center\">Your Site, Your Way</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 adds new features to the customizer to help take you through the initial setup of a theme, with non-destructive live previews of all your changes in one uninterrupted workflow.</p>\n<h3>Theme Starter Content</h3>\n<div style=\"width: 632px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement(\'video\');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-4596-1\" width=\"632\" height=\"346\" loop=\"1\" autoplay=\"1\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/starter-content.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/starter-content.mp4\">https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/starter-content.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>To help give you a solid base to build from, individual themes can provide starter content that appears when you go to customize your brand new site. This can range from placing a business information widget in the best location to providing a sample menu with social icon links to a static front page complete with beautiful images. Don’t worry &#8211; nothing new will appear on the live site until you’re ready to save and publish your initial theme setup.</p>\n<div style=\"float: left;width: 48%;margin: 0\">\n<h3>Edit Shortcuts</h3>\n<div style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-4596-2\" width=\"300\" height=\"173\" poster=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-Edit-Shortcuts.jpg\" loop=\"1\" autoplay=\"1\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/edit-shortcuts.mp4?_=2\" /><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/edit-shortcuts.mp4\">https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/edit-shortcuts.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>Visible icons appear to show you which parts of your site can be customized while live previewing. Click on a shortcut and get straight to editing.

Now you can add new pages while building menus instead of leaving the customizer and abandoning your changes. Once you’ve published your customizations, you’ll have new pages ready for you to fill with content.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"float: right;width: 48%;margin: 0\">\n<h3>Custom CSS</h3>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-4607 size-medium alignright\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-CSS.jpg?resize=300%2C158&#038;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-CSS.jpg?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-CSS.jpg?w=760&amp;ssl=1 760w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Sometimes you just need a few visual tweaks to make your site perfect.

Add more languages to your site and a user language option will show up in your user’s profiles.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center\">Introducing REST API Content Endpoints</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 comes with REST API endpoints for posts, comments, terms, users, meta, and settings.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4600 alignnone\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-API.jpg?resize=632%2C205&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-API.jpg?resize=1024%2C332&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-API.jpg?resize=300%2C97&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-API.jpg?resize=768%2C249&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-API.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-API.jpg?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Content endpoints provide machine-readable external access to your WordPress site with a clear, standards-driven interface, paving the way for new and innovative methods of interacting with sites through plugins, themes, apps, and beyond.

Just as JavaScript is a near necessity for smoother user experiences and more modern PHP versions are critical for performance, SSL just makes sense as the next hurdle our users are going to face.</p>\n<p>SSL basically means the link between your browser and the server is encrypted. SSL used to be difficult to implement, and often expensive or slow. Modern browsers, and the incredible success of projects like <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> have made getting a certificate to secure your site fast, free, and something we think every host should support by default, especially in a post-Snowden era. Google also weighs <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html\">SSL as a search engine ranking factor</a> and will begin <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-will-soon-shame-all-websites-that-are-unencrypted-chrome-https\">flagging unencrypted sites in Chrome</a>.</p>\n<p>First, early in 2017, we will only promote hosting partners that provide a SSL certificate by default in their accounts. Later we will begin to assess which features, such as API authentication, would benefit the most from SSL and make them only enabled when SSL is there.</p>\n<p>Separately, I also think the performance improvements in PHP7 are particularly impressive, and major kudos to everyone who worked on that. We will consider whether hosts use PHP7 by default for new accounts next year as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"4588\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"WordPress 4.7 Release Candidate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-release-candidate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 04:26:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:328:\"The release candidate for WordPress 4.7 is now available.

The REST API endpoints saw a number of bugfixes and notably now have anonymous comment off by default.</p>\n<p>Not sure where to start with testing?

We&#8217;ve been working on a lot of things, many of them to make getting your site set up the way you want it much easier. Here are some of the bigger items to test and help us find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://2017.wordpress.net/\"><strong>Twenty Seventeen</strong></a> &#8211; A brand new default theme brings your site to life with immersive featured images, video headers, and subtle animations. With a focus on business sites, it features multiple sections on the front page as well as widgets, navigation and social menus, a logo, and more. Personalize its asymmetrical grid with a custom color scheme and showcase your multimedia content with post formats. Our default theme for 2017 works great in many languages, for any abilities, and on any device.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Headers</strong> &#8211; Sometimes a big atmospheric video as a moving header image is just what you need to showcase your wares; go ahead and try it out with Twenty Seventeen. Need some video inspiration?

He proposed that the new feature be displayed on first install or update, disabled by default in the admin with a control available under Settings->General. One option he suggests is shipping it as a plugin that auto-installs on opt-in and auto-uninstalls on opt-out. He also identified a few examples of core data that could be tracked, including number of themes and plugins installed, frequency of use of specific views (Settings, Customizer, etc), current version, update status, locale, and language.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress prides itself on being an application built by the user for the user,&#8221; Rand-Hendriksen <a href=\"https://mor10.com/the-case-for-wordpress-telemetry/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;The problem is with the popularity and reach of WordPress today, the distance between the WordPress 1% (or even .1%) and the average user is becoming so vast we (the people who contribute to WordPress core) know almost nothing about the actual people who use WordPress or how they use the application.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During the WordPress 4.7 development cycle, Rand-Hendriksen said he was involved in several conversations where participants assumed the use of features without any data to back up their opinions. He contends that WordPress contributors do not have the necessary data to know how users are interacting with the application and its features.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The general argument was that based on the 80/20 rule, certain features should be added while others should be removed,&#8221; Rand-Hendriksen said. &#8220;I kept brining up the well known fact we don’t have a clue what features 80%, or even 20%, of WordPress users actually use so any claim of validity in the 80/20 rule is guesswork at best.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His proposal states that all the data collected should be public for transparency and also made available to end-users in the admin and on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The idea has had a few months to marinate and has generated some discussion about what a prototype would entail. Core committer Ella Van Dorpe created an experimental <a href=\"https://github.com/iseulde/wp-data\" target=\"_blank\">wp-data</a> standalone plugin for tracking a few simple interactions with the editor. Participants in the discussion recommended creating an Elasticsearch/Logstash setup for storing the data, technologies that the WordPress.org systems team have deployed before.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think a good summary is that there are a lot of hurdles in the way and currently no one has time to work on it,&#8221; Greg Brown, a Data Wrangler at Automattic, said in a followup <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418#comment:5\" target=\"_blank\">discussion on the ticket</a> three weeks ago. &#8220;Ultimately, I think the biggest blocker is getting someone with the time, inclination, and persistence to work on this. Getting it deployed onto .org is the right thing to do eventually, but I suspect it will take quite a while.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress lead developer Dion Hulse <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418#comment:6\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> that WordPress is already tracking many of these stats and that creating a prototype on WordPress.org infrastructure would be the best option forward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It would also be valuable to see how our existing stats system can compliment or be replaced by the proposal here though,&#8221; Hulse said. &#8220;I mention this as most of the stats from the original description are already tracked, just not exposed in any form. The only new thing mentioned here is the Frequency of use of specific views (Settings, Customizer, etc) and transparency part (which would still probably only be anonymized summaries, not exact data).&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress Telemetry Project Provides a Solution to Long-Standing Privacy Concerns</h3>\n<p>Moving WordPress&#8217; current data tracking into a more transparent opt-in feature would also provide a solution to some long-standing privacy concerns raised by contributors in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16778\" target=\"_blank\">a six-year-old trac ticket</a>. WordPress tracks the number of blogs and users in a given installation, along with the installation URL in the headers, in order to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16778#comment:67\" target=\"_blank\">facilitate update requests</a> that may become problematic, particularly in the case of large multisite installations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even if a user knows that some data needs to be passed for a version check of core, plugins, or themes, the amount of data passed to remote is obviously more than needed to do the version check,&#8221; one contributor <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16778#comment:14\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the ticket. &#8220;But users should be made aware upfront so they can freely decide on their own if they want to instead of being forced to support the project with their usage-data. They could be offered an opt-in to do so.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The number of registered users I have on my site tied to the URL that is sent with tracking request gives out vital information on how well my business could be doing &#8211; information that is mine and mine only,&#8221; WordPress plugin developer Danny van Kooten said. &#8220;At the very least we could make it very clear that WordPress is tracking this information and what exactly it is doing with it. I really do not think there is any excuse for that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Developers can filter the data to satisfy their privacy concerns but it is somewhat inextricable from the update process for larger multisite installations. It&#8217;s also too big of a technical hurdle for most regular users who would be better served by a simple UI allowing them to opt out of data collection.</p>\n<p>Rand-Hendriksen&#8217;s WordPress telemetry proposal gives the project an opportunity to formalize what data is being collected, state the purpose behind it, and allow users to choose if they want to be included.</p>\n<h3>Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) May Push WordPress Towards More Transparent Data Collection</h3>\n<p>Progress on both the Telemetry project and the ticket regarding privacy concerns has been slow. Neither seem to be a priority among contributors, but Europe&#8217;s <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ%3AL%3A2016%3A119%3ATOC\" target=\"_blank\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) may provide the impetus needed to push WordPress towards more transparent and responsible data collection.</p>\n<p>The GDPR is an overhaul of data protection law in Europe with far more stringent requirements than the previous laws. It requires full disclosure for any data collection and standardized privacy notices to help users understand where and how the data is being used. Consent to have data collected must be confirmed and users have the right to access their own data. It also includes the right of erasure or &#8220;the right to be forgotten,&#8221; which allows users to remove their data from the web. The GDPR goes into effect in May 2018.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://webdevlaw.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Heather Burns</a>, a digital law specialist who consults and speaks extensively on internet laws and policies, encouraged WordPress contributors to frame the discussion regarding privacy concerns in terms of working towards compliance with a specific framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the purposes of this discussion, core should work to the GDPR standard for two reasons,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;The first reason lies in cultural differences. The US does not have a single overarching data protection and privacy regulation, unlike Europe, where we have this data protection regime which applies to all personal data regardless of use, format, or sector. So GDPR gives developers &#8211; even those outside the EU &#8211; a robust, healthy, and very tough set of standards to follow. Given what we have seen coming out of the White House in the past week, GDPR also provides as good a starting point as any for defensive user protection.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The second is that GDPR is extraterritorial. It applies to the personal data of anyone in Europe regardless of where the online service is located. If your business is in the US or Australia or Israel but you have European users, you have to protect their data to European GDPR standards.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pricewaterhouse Coopers recently surveyed 200 US-based multinational companies with more than 500 employees and found that <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/assets/pwc-gdpr-series-pulse-survey.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">77% plan to spend $1 million or more on GDPR compliance</a>. More than half of those surveyed cited GDPR readiness as the highest priority on their data-privacy and security agendas.</p>\n<p>The hefty penalties of noncompliance are one of the driving factors behind American companies spending millions of dollars on satisfying the requirements of this new European regulation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;GDPR is a complete overhaul of its dialup-era (1995) predecessor and one of the areas that has been beefed up is its teeth,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;Businesses which are found to be in noncompliance by a European member state&#8217;s data protection regulator, whether that is your small app studio all the way up to Automattic, could face penalties of up to 4% of the business&#8217;s global annual turnover. Now there’s some solid context for the philosophical discussion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, not everyone is convinced that the GDPR will be beneficial to consumers. Kitty Kolding, CEO and president of <a href=\"http://www.infocore.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Infocore Inc</a>, an international company that specializes in sourcing market data, told <a href=\"https://www.exchangewire.com/blog/2016/07/07/an-american-perspective-the-three-worst-things-about-the-eu-gdpr/\" target=\"_blank\">ExchangeWire</a> that she believes the GDPR will undermine &#8220;the sanctity of consumers&#8217; data privacy and security&#8221; and hobble marketing and advertising worldwide.</p>\n<p>She contends that provisions like the &#8220;right to be forgotten,&#8221; which require customer data to be retained beyond the time that it&#8217;s in active use, will make that data more susceptible to hacking. Additionally, the enforcement body for the new legislation claims authority over companies, with the right to search and seize records, without any oversight or appeals.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Every company everywhere that handles data on EU citizens is also automatically subject to this group’s absolute power – though it’s anybody’s guess how the EU believes they can enforce such a broad mandate outside its own borders,&#8221; Kolding said.</p>\n<p>Currently, only two trac tickets <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/search?q=GDPR\" target=\"_blank\">mention the GDPR</a> so it&#8217;s not yet clear how WordPress core will respond to the requirements of the new legislation. Burns recommends that WordPress core contributors go through the process of conducting a <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/privacy-by-design/\" target=\"_blank\">privacy impact assessment</a> to determine the right way forward.</p>\n<p>Regardless of WordPress&#8217; response, companies and organizations that depend on the software  will need to assume the responsibility of their own compliance, as these requirements extend far beyond core. The GDPR applies to anything added into a website or app that collects users&#8217; data. For example, many contact form plugins store submissions inside the WordPress database and site owners will want to re-examine how users are notified of this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the main changes with GDPR is called the accountability principle,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;Businesses collecting personal data must be completely transparent and accountable over what data they are collecting, how they are storing it and where, who it is being passed to (such as third parties), who has access to it, and how long it is retained. Users also have the right to request that any data collected about them must be deleted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no WordPress plugin that will instantly make a site GDPR compatible. Drupal has a <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gdpr\" target=\"_blank\">GDPR module</a> that aims to make sure the site follows the guidelines and legislation set by the EU, but it doesn&#8217;t cover all requirements. Automating an assessment of privacy impact for a site using a CMS and potentially dozens of third-party extensions is a complex endeavor. This is one regulation that will require business owners to educate themselves and implement privacy practices that put users&#8217; interests first.</p>\n<p>With the deadline for compliance closing in, WordPress has an opportunity to re-evaluate how the project handles user privacy and make steps towards greater transparency. If contributors are looking into collecting more data to assist decision-making on features, as outlined in Rand-Hendriksen&#8217;s telemetry proposal, this project provides an avenue for working towards GDPR compliance. These privacy concerns are especially important to address when considering WordPress for government, healthcare, educational institutes, and other data sensitive websites.</p>\n<p>Burns views the GDPR&#8217;s compliance deadline as a fresh opportunity for WordPress to build better privacy structures and legal certainty using the regulation as a healthy baseline for all users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone needs to be working in implementations for their own businesses and sites in any case ahead of deadline day, in addition to any changes that need to be made in the WP code,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to remember that GDPR compliance is not a tick box you can squeeze in next April.

The change occurred without warning and surprised those who manage multiple WooCommerce stores for clients.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WooCommerceWPComLoginScreen.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>WooCommerce Login Screen Requiring a WP.com Account\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bradkgriffin?lang=en\">Brad Griffin</a>, who maintains a number of client sites that run WooCommerce, raised concerns over the change <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1388565454538998/\">in a post</a> on the Advanced WordPress Facebook group.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When dealing with businesses, asking someone at a corporate level to take their email address and make a WordPress.com account is a bit problematic,&#8221; Griffin said. &#8220;They&#8217;re confused as to why they need to do this. They don&#8217;t have immediate access to that email address on a Saturday or Sunday.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So, without warning, without notice, without a heads up or anything else, no one can now access anything in the back-end of the WooCommerce account unless there is a WP.com single sign on account using oAuth.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For those not interested in signing in with their WordPress.com account, WooCommerce.com attempts to alleviate concerns <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/signin-with-wordpress/not-interested/\">in an article</a> that outlines the benefits. The benefits include an option to enable 2-Factor Authentication, access to eCommerce services, and viewing purchase history.</p>\n<p>After speaking to Todd Wilkens, Head of WooCommerce at Automattic, Griffin published <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXfugcpuD4Y\">video</a>, explaining the change and offers suggestions for those who manage multiple WooCommerce stores for clients. The suggestions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make 100% sure that you, your client, your store, your account, or anything else has a WordPress.COM account ~ not just WordPress.org!</li>\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve used an email and login and you are setup for WordPress.COM (not .org), make absolutely certain that you are using an incognito browser window when logging into WooCommerce.com.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using a private or incognito browser window won&#8217;t remember the login as the cookie is not saved. If you don&#8217;t use incognito mode and like, comment, or subscribe to items on WordPress.com or any site that uses <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/oauth2/\">WordPress.com&#8217;s oAuth protocol</a>, those actions will occur under the client&#8217;s account. &#8220;<span class=\"_5yl5\">Many users might not fully realize how far-reaching that one little oAuth endpoint <strong>actually is</strong> and the vastly significant number of touch-points it can affect,&#8221; Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p>Wilkens <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2017/01/woocommerce-requires-wordpress-account/\">published a post</a> on the official WooCommerce blog explaining why the login system was switched, &#8220;We found that a lot of customers were using <i>two accounts</i> to access services from <i>one</i> company,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To simplify that, we are centralizing on the WordPress.com login. Automattic has done this with previous acquisitions, like Polldaddy, for the same reasons. Now you can use only one login to access all Automattic services, including WooCommerce, Jetpack, VaultPress and more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So far, the WooCommerce team has tracked more than 10K successful logins to the new system and are monitoring feedback on social media. Only a small subset of users have reported issues due to confusion, &#8220;Over half of the 1% of users who opened tickets were confused between having a WordPress.com login vs. the login they use for their self-hosted WordPress install,&#8221; Wilkens said.</p>\n<h2>A Better Way to Manage Multiple Client Accounts Is in the Works</h2>\n<p>WooCommerce.com joins a growing collection of Automattic services, sites, and products that require a WordPress.com user account. As the number of reasons to have an account increases, perhaps it&#8217;s time for Automattic to create a client management system. A system that allows users to assign people who can act on their behalf, similar to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_attorney\">power of attorney</a>.</p>\n<p>An example that comes to mind is <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/pro#reduce\">GoDaddy Pro</a>. GoDaddy Pro allows consultants to access all of their client&#8217;s products in one place. They can also manage aspects of their hosting and purchase products on their behalf.</p>\n<p>The change to WooCommerce.com has emphasized the unfriendliness of the site&#8217;s current system for those who manage multiple client accounts. &#8220;We had already re-prioritized a number of features on our roadmap to make life for developers managing dozens of client accounts much smoother, and hope to have something to be able to announce there soon,&#8221; Wilkens said.</p>\n<p>If you manage multiple client accounts and are affected by this change, Wilkens suggests <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/\">opening a ticket</a> for advice. You can also provide feedback by voting on a poll at the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2017/01/woocommerce-requires-wordpress-account/\">bottom of the post</a> that asks how your experience was switching to a WordPress.com login.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 20:02:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: Micro.blog Project Surges Past $65K on Kickstarter, Gains Backing from DreamHost\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=65437\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/micro-blog-project-surges-past-65k-on-kickstarter-gains-backing-from-dreamhost\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9480:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/micro-blog-logo.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>With one week remaining on its Kickstarter campaign, the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/micro-blog-surpasses-kickstarter-funding-goal-set-to-launch-new-social-network-for-independent-microblogs\" target=\"_blank\">Micro.blog indie microblogging project</a> has surged past its original $10K funding goal with $66,710 pledged by 2,381 backers. This puts project creator Manton Reece closer to his <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing/posts/1785295\" target=\"_blank\">stretch goal of $80K</a>, which would enable him to develop a Safe Replies feature to preemptively combat abuse on the platform and hire a part-time community manager.</p>\n<p>Micro.blog also <a href=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/2017/01/24/pitching-support-open-web/\" target=\"_blank\">picked up support from DreamHost</a> this week, pushing the project past the $50K mark. The hosting company pledged $5,000 towards the campaign.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What ever happened to the vision of the open web as a distributed network of websites that were owned by their creators?&#8221; said Jonathan LaCour, SVP of Product and Technology at DreamHost. &#8220;We’d like to make it as easy as possible to launch a WordPress-powered microblog on DreamHost that integrates well with Manton’s upcoming Micro.blog service.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DreamHost (and all other hosting companies) obviously have a vested interest in getting people to see the need to have their own digital presence. However, the biggest obstacle for WordPress customers is making it convenient to join the IndieWeb. DreamHost is planning to take its support of Micro.blog one step further and create an easy way for customers to get started with independent microblogs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a followup to our contribution to Manton&#8217;s Kickstarter campaign, we&#8217;re planning on working on making a streamlined, pre-configured Indie microblog with WordPress at DreamHost,&#8221; LaCour said in the <a href=\"https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-01-25#bottom\" target=\"_blank\">#indieweb</a> channel on IRC yesterday. &#8220;I tend to agree that a simplified, pre-packaged WordPress setup would go a long way to driving Indieweb adoption.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked whether the company would be utilizing Micro.blog or some other service, LaCour said it has not been decided yet. He said the idea is that people could create an independent microblog hosted at DreamHost that is compatible with Micro.blog and other indie microblogs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our major focus at the moment is getting people excited about owning their own website (and entire digital identity),&#8221; LaCour said.</p>\n<h3>Micro.blog is Aiming for Incremental Webmention Support</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://webmention.net/draft/\" target=\"_blank\">Webmention</a> is a protocol similar to pingback for notifying a URL when a website links to it and also for requesting notifications when another site mentions one of your URLs. It is an important part of facilitating decentralized communication across the web. On January 12, 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Social/WG\" target=\"_blank\">Social Web Working Group</a> published a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-webmention-20170112/#w3c-recommendation-12-january-2017\" target=\"_blank\">W3C Recommendation of Webmention</a> with the specification contributed by the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IndieWeb</a> community.</p>\n<p>WordPress doesn&#8217;t natively offer <a href=\"https://webmention.net/draft/\" target=\"_blank\">Webmention</a> support and the core trac <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35435\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> for adding the feature has had little discussion.</p>\n<p>During a preliminary <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1452663582010063\" target=\"_blank\">discussion on Slack</a> last year, WordPress lead developer Dion Hulse said he thought Webmentions would be a great feature plugin and that there are a few people interested in it. There hasn&#8217;t been much movement on this front in core, but a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/\" target=\"_blank\">Webmention plugin</a> is available in the directory.</p>\n<p>Reece is working on incorporating IndieWeb protocols into Micro.blog but said it will likely launch with incremental support for Webmention.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It might take a little while to get everything IndieWeb in there, but that&#8217;s the eventual goal,&#8221; Reece <a href=\"https://chat.indieweb.org/2017-01-25#t1485379721875000\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;I&#8217;m committed to Micropub and microformats and still exploring how best to support Webmention. (It might be partial support with more later.)&#8221;</p>\n<p>Micro.blog doesn&#8217;t currently handle mentions and replies using Webmention but Reece said his eventual goal is to include it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first step to me is getting more people their own microblog so that the infrastructure for cross-site replies is even possible,&#8221; Reece said.</p>\n<h3>Micro.blog Puts the Focus on Indie Microblogging, Instead of Replacing Twitter</h3>\n<p>Reece also <a href=\"http://www.manton.org/2017/01/microblogging-community-on-slack.html\" target=\"_blank\">launched a Slack community</a> where the project&#8217;s backers can discuss Micro.blog and other microblogging topics. He said he initially had reservations with starting something on Slack but was surprised to see the community has already grown to more than 300 members.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn’t want to distract from any posts that should happen in the open on blogs,&#8221; Reece said. &#8220;Some discussion just fits better in chat, though. There’s an emerging community of indie microbloggers. Having a place to share tips, tools, and ask questions about Micro.blog just makes sense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many of the project&#8217;s backers are eager to create a community of their own and are interested in using Micro.blog as a Twitter replacement. Other services have attempted to provide alternatives to posting directly on Twitter but none have caught on enough to significantly push IndieWeb adoption forward. <a href=\"http://app.net\" target=\"_blank\">App.net</a>, one of the most promising ad-free, microblogging networks, went into maintenance mode in 2014 and will be shutting down March 15, 2017.</p>\n<p>Reece, who was an early fan of App.net, <a href=\"http://www.manton.org/2017/01/thank-you-to-app-net.html\" target=\"_blank\">published a thank you note</a> to the service&#8217;s creators for trying something risky and creating a community around their ideas. He believes it&#8217;s the right time for another open platform to emerge.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don’t need just another Twitter or Facebook clone,&#8221; Reece said. &#8220;We need a new platform that encourages blogging on the open web.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Reece is preparing Micro.blog from the outset to be capable of replacing Twitter&#8217;s functionality, which is one of the reasons he is focusing so heavily on ensuring the platform <a href=\"https://twitter.com/manton2/status/821084145782759425\" target=\"_blank\">doesn&#8217;t get overrun with abuse</a>. Reece wants to avoid the pitfalls that have contributed to some of the more negative aspects of Twitter, but his focus is on encouraging people to blog from their own space.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Micro.blog is a success if more people blog,&#8221; Reece <a href=\"https://twitter.com/manton2/status/820372146375524359\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;To provide value it doesn’t need to replace Twitter, but it can.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The project&#8217;s mobile app is key to making it convenient for users to read other people&#8217;s posts and post directly to their own websites from the same interface. Reece shared another <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing/posts/1783438\" target=\"_blank\">preview of the iPhone and iPad app</a> that will be ready at launch and said he hopes there will be other apps developed by the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most RSS traditional readers can&#8217;t post,&#8221; Reece said. &#8220;I think this makes for a more complete experience, and because it&#8217;s just a blog I can still use other apps and platforms to post.&#8221; He plans to give Micro.blog a 280 character limit before truncating the post.</p>\n<p>Keeping the timeline fast and making posting convenient will be critical to the platform&#8217;s success as an alternative to the dominant social media silos. Polling blogs for new content is not very aggressive in the current prototype but Reece is tuning this to provide a better experience. The platform uses rssCloud and WebSub (formerly PubSubHubbub) to provide a more Twitter-like, real-time experience.</p>\n<p>Micro.blog seems to be landing at the right time, as the idea has already resonated with more than 2,300 people willing to back the project. The service hasn&#8217;t even launched but the concept behind it is already attracting a supportive community eager to explore better ways of powering microblogging on the web.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You don’t replace Twitter overnight, or even try to,&#8221; Reece said. &#8220;But step by step, we’re going to end up with a better web, and I think independent microblogging is part of that.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 22:56:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.7.2 Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4676\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/01/wordpress-4-7-2-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1508:\"<p>WordPress 4.7.2 is now available.

For me, the blueprint for finding fulfillment looked something like this:</p>\n<p>Step 1. Get good grades in school.</p>\n<p>Step 2. Attend a nice college.</p>\n<p>Step 3. Land a secure job with an attractive salary and benefits.</p>\n<p>Step 4. Find a nice man that would make a good husband and father…and marry him.</p>\n<p>Step 5. Have children.</p>\n<p>Step 6. Die peacefully at an old age. (ha!)</p>\n<p>I was convinced that if I simply followed this blueprint, I’d find security and acceptance. And with the exception of Step #6 (a step I’m hoping to postpone for some time), I was able to accomplish everything I’d set out to do. My grades in school were outstanding, which set me up to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois. After graduating in 2000, I was presented with several job opportunities. Ultimately, I accepted a position at Procter &amp; Gamble as an engineer for Charmin. Within a year of starting that job, I met my future husband. We married in 2004 and had our first child in 2007. Another child followed in 2008. I was right on track with my blueprint!</p>\n<p>And then everything fell apart.</p>\n<h2><strong>A breakdown wasn’t in the plan</strong></h2>\n<p>In 2008, I suffered my first real breakdown. I spent several weeks doing my best to get through each day, doing what I needed to as an employee, wife, and mom and trying hard not to let other people down. I fought back tears when I needed to, only letting them flow in private. While the kids were sleeping, I’d escape into the world of TV sitcoms. I knew that something wasn’t right.</p>\n<p>While I had followed the blueprint for security, success, and happiness, I didn’t feel like I had achieved any of these things. I felt isolated at work. At home, I felt valued only if I were functioning as the perfect wife and mom. At the time, the solution seemed clear—quit my corporate job and focus 100% on my family. This, I was certain, would lead to ultimate happiness. So I took two extended maternity leaves, eventually leaving the corporate world to focus on being a stay-at-home mom.</p>\n<h2><strong>Who the hell am I?</strong></h2>\n<p>Being home with kids full-time, no matter how wonderful your kids may be, is by far the most challenging job. While I was grateful that I had the choice to be a stay-at-home-mom, being at home left me feeling alienated. I didn’t really know who I was anymore or how to get back to “myself.”</p>\n<p>So I started experimenting with things I simply felt like doing. These things weren’t part of any blueprint, and there was no guarantee of success or happiness. I just followed my heart.</p>\n<p>I needed something challenging to occupy my mind, so I dug out my sports card collection with the intent of finally organizing it. Looking through my old cards felt both nostalgic and therapeutic, and my head started spinning with other ideas. Business ideas. My dad had a successful e-bay business that seemed like a bit of fun, so I thought: <em>why not try selling sports cards on e-bay?</em> I didn’t want to sacrifice my personal collection, so over the course of a few months, I purchased nearly a million sports cards on Craigslist. After repackaging them into 1000-count boxes, I sold them for $10/box, doubling my money in a short period of time. I learned a lot about buying and selling on the Internet but more importantly, I felt like I had discovered something that was really “me.” It was challenging in a new and exciting way, and it fit in with my hectic mom schedule.</p>\n<p>This venture into the world of online business opened my eyes in a significant way. I started following entrepreneurs such as Gary Vaynerchuk and Chris Brogan, and flew to Houston for a Mom 2.0 Summit. I loved every blog post I read and all the people I was meeting. It was a whole new world filled with risk and uncertainty but grounded in the values of helping people and living a good life. THIS WAS PERFECT FOR ME.</p>\n<h2><strong>And then came WordPress</strong></h2>\n<p>In my newfound fascination with all things Internet-related, it wasn’t surprising that I stumbled upon this thing called WordPress. I had always wanted to build a website, and with the popularity of mom bloggers exploding, I naturally gravitated toward this “easy” platform for my blog. I started the ChicagoActons blog as a way to share our family adventures with others. Building the site was something I enjoyed more than I anticipated. It fed my love of problem solving and I felt great satisfaction in seeing something that I built on the Internet. And I could do it in between changing dirty diapers and cuddling with my kids.</p>\n<p>After building ChicagoActons and sharing it via social channels, I started to get requests to build sites for others. Some were paid assignments and some were not, but I was falling in love with using this tool and my brain to help others further efforts they were passionate about. I was finding myself again, and I felt happy.</p>\n<h2><strong>Where were WordCamps all my life?</strong></h2>\n<p>By 2010, two years into freelance WordPress development, I was ready to expand my horizons and see what others were doing with the platform. I heard about WordCamp Chicago, and bought a ticket to the event that would confirm that the path I was paving was the right one for me.</p>\n<p>At WordCamp Chicago 2010, I learned a great deal about developing with WordPress, but even more life changing were the people I met. They were such a diverse group and so different than I was, yet we all shared the same passion: to support one another in our pursuits to help others. And we all used WordPress as the tool to get the job done.</p>\n<p>The feeling of acceptance and growth that I experienced at my first WordCamp was the impetus I needed to continue down the path as a WordPress-based business entrepreneur. I wasn’t following a blueprint anymore, but I was finding success and security in ways that mattered to me.</p>\n<p>I was happy.</p>\n<h2><strong>Living my own blueprint</strong></h2>\n<p>Fast-forward to today. I couldn’t be more thankful for the life journey I’m on. My kids survived having me as a stay-at-home parent, and as a WordPress-based business entrepreneur, I feel challenged every day to be better at helping others build their passion-driven interests. I would not have gotten here had it not been for WordPress and the WordPress community, which emboldened me to abandon a blueprint for happiness that simply wasn’t working for me and instead embrace life on my own terms.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Screw the Blueprint.

The organizing team is embracing the challenge of delivering value to sponsors with workshops for those purchasing the two highest sponsorship levels:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This year, for the first time, we are introducing a third track during both conference days. The third track will be solely dedicated to sponsors, giving you the possibility to either hold a talk or a workshop. Like the other two tracks, the sponsor track will have a dedicated space (capacity for approx. 200 people), where the audience would have the opportunity to hear more about your business and product. You can decide whether you would like to use your time to talk more about your business, or to showcase.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The sponsors track has since been renamed to sponsors workshops, but the concept of a dedicated track remains the same. According to WCEU Sponsors Team coordinator Noel Tock, WordCamp Central&#8217;s transition into a public benefet corporation affords WordCamps more flexibility than previously allowed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This means we’d like to experiment with different concepts — seeking a higher return on investment for sponsors whilst at the same time protecting the core experience of the WordCamp itself,&#8221; Tock said.</p>\n<p>The new sponsors workshops target large companies, but WCEU organizers have also created a new concept for small businesses. Those that made less than one million Euro in 2016 will qualify for an affordable booth in the middle of the event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Similar to TechCrunch’s Startup Alley, we want to help highlight smaller companies or ones that have just started out,&#8221; Tock said. &#8220;Simply seeking out sponsorship funds the fastest way possible would not be fair to attendees. This helps makes the conversations and experiences a lot more diverse and balanced.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The sponsors workshops will not need to go through an approval process. They are perks belonging to the Super Admin and Admin sponsorship tiers and these top-level sponsors will have different options for how they want to use their slots.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They can run user workshops, pass on their slot to smaller players (plugin and theme authors) or find other creative session ideas,&#8221; Tock said. &#8220;The workshops will be clearly labeled and we’ll seek to provide an agenda/schedule on the same timeline as regular speakers.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Challenge of Delivering Value to Sponsors Without Stifling the Spirit of WordCamps</h3>\n<p>WordCamps are traditionally locally-organized, informal events that bring together attendees from all walks of life. Affordability is one of the hallmarks of a WordCamp, and ticket prices normally range from $20-50. The low cost of entry makes the events more inclusive, keeping the camps from becoming relegated only to elites and those who work for large companies. At a WordCamp, one can meet anyone &#8211; core developers, educators, CEOs of multi-million dollar companies, new users, developers, bloggers, and e-commerce store owners.</p>\n<p>To give you an idea of how uncommonly low WordCamp ticket prices are in comparison to other tech conferences, DrupalCon ranges from $450-600 per person. PHP UK tickets for the conference days are in the neighborhood of $500 and <a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PHP[World]</a> is nearly double that at $900. <a href=\"http://blog.cssconf.eu/2016/12/07/cssconfeu-tickets-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">CSSconf EU</a> tickets are $430. <a href=\"https://www.react-europe.org/#tickets\" target=\"_blank\">ReactEurope</a>, which is also being held in Paris, released its first round of tickets in the range of $680. WordCamp Europe <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">tickets</a> are €40.00 (approximately $43) because the vast majority of the cost of attendance is subsidized by sponsors.</p>\n<p>Now that WordCamp Europe has been running successfully for five years, Tock said it is easier to get sponsors on board. Sponsorship cost per attendee is one of the contributing factors. In 2016 WordCamp Europe sold 2,199 tickets and organizers expect to sell more than 3,000 this year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you compare the perks and size of the audience, you’ll find that WordCamp Europe can be anywhere from 20% to 50% cheaper then comparable WordCamps,&#8221; Tock said. &#8220;The bang for buck has meant we have a lot of returning sponsors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, as WCEU attendance and the event&#8217;s financial requirements have grown, so has the challenge to deliver value to sponsors who are contributing greater sums of money.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Asking potential sponsors for a few thousand a couple years back was easy enough,&#8221; Tock said. &#8220;Now that we’re looking for 50k+ Euros from certain sponsors, we need to up our game with it. This means early communication, well-defined packages, and more creative perks.&#8221; This year those perks include 360° booths, 30-second ads between talks, after-party branding, and the new sponsor workshops.</p>\n<p>I spoke to several other organizers of comparably large WordCamps and all of them were intrigued by the idea of sponsor workshops and interested to see how the experiment turns out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think on the surface it could be considered a controversial idea, but in reality it&#8217;s just giving sponsors a different kind of voice,&#8221; WordCamp Miami organizer David Bisset said. &#8220;If it&#8217;s done in a way that treats all sponsors fairly and is a voluntary track, then in some ways it doesn&#8217;t differ from a sponsor area, outside of narrowing the spotlight.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bisset said he&#8217;s interested to see how successful this approach is but notes that it probably would only work for the largest WordCamps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I honestly don&#8217;t know which side of the fence this lies on in regards the spirit of WordCamps,&#8221; Bisset said. &#8220;There have been controversial issues and challenges regarding sponsors and WordCamps in the past. It&#8217;s a challenge to give sponsors the most bang for their buck, treat everyone fairly, and be a model WordCamp. The jury is still out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress Orlando organizer Lisa Melegari thinks the idea of sponsor workshops may bring some legitimacy to what is known as the &#8220;hallway track,&#8221; where attendees congregate when not attending a session.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a really interesting concept,&#8221; Melegari said. &#8220;There&#8217;s already the joke out there that there&#8217;s a phantom extra track at most WordCamps &#8211; the Hallway Track. I think this would take that and actually give some legitimacy to the myth.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Melegari said WordCamp Orlando organizers have seen a significant shift in sponsor availability and enthusiasm in the past few years, especially after WordCamp US launched. She said their local camp lost several past sponsors to the larger WordCamp US. Other sponsors have decided to just focus on local camps and some have dropped sponsorship altogether.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I really think we need to give our sponsors more opportunity to benefit their businesses, since their success allows them to continue to support our camps,&#8221; Melegari said. &#8220;Is it worth an entire extra track? Maybe not. That would put an unfair burden on camps that already have difficulty getting space and could deter sponsors from supporting a camp that cannot offer that accommodation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Melegari said she likes the idea of allowing sponsors to have a more prominent demo opportunity as long as it doesn&#8217;t overshadow the speakers, who volunteer their time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having been a speaker with a very low attendance at a few talks, it&#8217;s disheartening, but understandable that another speaker&#8217;s talk is more popular,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I would be afraid the sponsor track would take away the spotlight on speakers.&#8221; From an organizer&#8217;s perspective, she is interested to see how sponsor workshops can deliver a better value for sponsorship.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We really do need to provide a better case for WordCamp sponsorship besides exposure, because many of our recurring sponsors have a smaller and smaller pool of new eyes every camp,&#8221; Melegari said. &#8220;If we are going to keep growing in camp numbers, we&#8217;re going to have to figure out something to keep all the camps financially afloat.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Alx Block, WordCamp US 2015-16 Organizer, understands the importance of sponsors and volunteers, who covered the bulk of the $516 actual cost per person for the most recent event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that we’re at an impasse when it comes to adding value for sponsors, especially at the larger camps,&#8221; Block said. &#8220;On the one hand, each sponsorship is really a <em>scholarship</em> for attendees, allowing each camp to greatly reduce the ticket price so that more people can attend and get value from the camp. On the other hand, there’s limited value for the sponsors in terms of ROI. We’ve never thought of it as a business investment, but it’s certainly time to think about that more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keeping ticket prices low, putting on a quality event, and offering an array of perks for sponsorship is a tremendous balancing act for organizers. WordCamp Europe is one of fastest-growing camps that has experimented with doing this at a larger scale every year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you get into the larger dollar amounts that larger camps ask, it’s a different kind of ballgame, and I think that we need to revisit the value that a business receives as part of their sponsorship,&#8221; Block said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think something like sponsor workshops is a really neat idea. I can imagine that it doesn’t come with much overhead in terms of actual planning, and will give the sponsors something solid that they can plan for in terms of being able to pitch their product or service.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Historically, workshops have been events that are ancillary to the main tracks. WordCamp Europe&#8217;s plan to run them alongside speaker sessions is a bold experiment. Sponsors will have a great deal of flexibility with how they can utilize their workshop slots, so it will be interesting to see if they choose to incentivize attendance in some way or opt to pass them along to other speakers as a sponsored talk.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think there’s a line between a sponsor &#8216;track&#8217; and sponsor &#8216;workshops,&#8217; which WCEU hasn’t clearly defined yet,&#8221; Block said. &#8220;I’m sure that their intention isn’t to have 1/3 of the talks be by people who paid to be there. From what I understand, the intention is to have the top-tier sponsors (maybe 4-6 of them) present on a smaller stage in a kind of rolling fashion, to supplement the full tracks &#8211; meaning, it would be a great place for an attendee to go during a time when neither of the other sessions appeals to them, or they’re interested in learning more about a specific product.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Block said he has seen this type of sponsor perk at other non-WordPress conferences and has sat in on sessions that piqued his interest.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But this is the real question in my mind: Can we offer something like this without turning WordCamps into a trade show?&#8221; Block said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think now that we’re growing so much with these large camps, it’s the perfect time to ask these questions and figure out exactly what type of event WordCamp is. We grow as the community grows, and WordCamp should always reflect the community’s interest. If there’s interest in giving sponsors a place to talk about their wares, I’m all about it, but I’d always want the community to come first.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 20:38:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Wix Removes GPL-Licensed WordPress Code from Mobile App, Forks Original MIT Library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=65143\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"https://wptavern.com/wix-removes-gpl-licensed-wordpress-code-from-mobile-app-forks-original-mit-library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14743:\"<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ForkedFeaturedImage.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/winterofdiscontent/3301816514/\">winterofdiscontent</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p>In October 2016, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/10/wix-and-the-gpl/\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Mullenweg called out Wix</a> for using GPL-licensed code from the WordPress mobile app and distributing it in its proprietary app. After identifying a path for Wix to comply with the license, Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/mullenweg-takes-aim-at-wix-over-gpl-abuses-wix-response-fails-to-address-licensing-issue\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed he would be willing to go to court to protect the GPL</a>.</p>\n<p>Wix CEO Avishai Abrahami&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.wix.com/blog/2016/10/dear-matt-mullenweg-an-open-letter-from-wix-coms-ceo-avishai-abrahami/\" target=\"_blank\">response</a> to the allegations failed to address the issue of licensing, dodging the question with references to other open source contributions. Abrahami seemed to indicate that Wix would open source its mobile app but was not clear whether it would be GPL licensed:</p>\n<p>&#8220;We always shared and admired your commitment to give back, which is exactly why we have those 224 open source projects, and thousands more bugs/improvements available to the open source community and we will release the app you saw as well,&#8221; Abrahami said.</p>\n<p>The Wix Twitter account also gave the impression that the entire app would be released under the GPL:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yairwein\">@yairwein</a> We\'ll release the code on Github, where we also shared our previous projects: <a href=\"https://t.co/FBhp2Kd5wn\">https://t.co/FBhp2Kd5wn</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Wix.com (@Wix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wix/status/792656290854174721\">October 30, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Publicly communicating these intentions bought the company time to educate its developers on the implications of the GPL and find another path forward for the app.</p>\n<p>The app has not been released under the GPL and Wix has discontinued development on the GPL-licensed repositories. On November 1, 2016, Wix changed the license on the <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-wordpress-editor\" target=\"_blank\">react-native-wordpress-editor</a>, the repository that was forked from the WordPress mobile app, to GPLv2. The next day, they began work on <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-zss-rich-text-editor/\" target=\"_blank\">react-native-zss-rich-text-editor</a>, a new repository forked from the original MIT-licensed library that the WordPress mobile app code built upon.</p>\n<p>It appears that Wix never planned on complying with the GPL, since the company immediately began working on an alternative approach. Wix has since released updates to its mobile apps and presumably has incorporated its own editor component that is based on the original MIT-licensed library.</p>\n<p>It is not clear whether Wix completely started over with its fork or if the company&#8217;s developers incorporated some of the commits previously made in the WordPress mobile app&#8217;s GPL-licensed fork. Wix has not responded to numerous attempts to contact them for an official statement.</p>\n<h3>Wix Invents Its Own &#8220;Enhanced&#8221; MIT License for the Forked Library</h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s where the story takes an odd turn. Instead of distributing the new editor code under a <a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses\" target=\"_blank\">standard open source library</a>, Wix has written its own license, which it is calling the <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-zss-rich-text-editor/blob/master/LICENSE\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Enhanced&#8221; MIT license (EMIT)</a>. It explicitly prohibits relicensing under the GPL and requires the developer to license modifications under the EMIT:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This license is exactly like the MIT License, with one exception – Any distribution of this source code or any modification thereof in source code format, must be done under the Enhanced MIT license and not under any other licenses, such as GPL.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, the license prohibits the code being redistributed under any copyleft license:</p>\n<blockquote><p>when the Software is distributed as source code, the licensee is prohibited to change the license of the Software to any “viral” copyleft-type license, such as, inter alia: GPL, LGPL, EPL, MPL, etc.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wix explained the reason behind the creation of the new license in its introduction, citing what it calls a &#8220;bug&#8221; in the MIT license. The MIT permits developers to re-license their modifications as GPL. The text of the &#8220;Enhanced&#8221; MIT license characterizes this practice as bullying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We believe MIT license has a bug since it allows others to use it against its nature. Our belief is that the MIT license is intended to make source code available to anyone who wants to use it without additional obligations, but we have found cases where someone takes a project licensed under MIT license, adds a few lines of source code to it, and then changes the licensing to a different, more restrictive license which is against the nature and the intent of the MIT license. By doing so, the source code released under the original MIT is no longer a true “free/open” source code, thus undermining the intention of the original creator of the source code.</p>\n<p>The concept of this Enhanced MIT license is simple and more robust – you can do what you want with this source code, exactly like any other MIT license, but if you release it again as open source (even if modified), you must release it under this Enhanced MIT license – to be clear, this is not a “viral” license, it only refers to the actual source code released under this license and not to other components interacting with it. If GPL is a viral license, this license can be described as a “robust” one as it prevents licensing changes that are against its nature and it defends its own licensing principles. The essence of the Enhanced MIT license is to prevent bullies from using open source code that is truly free and open under the MIT License and turning it into other viral and more restrictive licenses – such as GPL.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The license has only ever been used in this particular instance and does not appear to have been written by a lawyer or someone who has studied copyright and licensing issues professionally. I contacted the Free Software Foundation&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.fsf.org/licensing\" target=\"_blank\">licensing and compliance team</a> regarding the legitimacy of Wix&#8217;s &#8220;Enhanced&#8221; MIT license. FSF copyright and licensing associate Donald Robertson III said the team is currently reviewing it and may require legal counsel before making a definitive comment. When they have completed the review, they will publish a statement and list the license in the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html\" target=\"_blank\">FSF directory of free and non-free software licenses</a>. These are also broken down into copyleft and GPL-compatible classifications.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As you can see from the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLIncompatibleLicenses\" target=\"_blank\">GPL-incompatible licenses</a>, there are plenty of free software licenses that are incompatible with the GPL, and many of those licenses would be incompatible with other copyleft licenses on the same basis,&#8221; Robertson said. &#8220;So it is possible for a license to be free even if it doesn&#8217;t work well with the GPL. We&#8217;ll have to do some review on this particular license before we can make any comment specific to it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wix has not submitted its EMIT license to the Open Source Initiative, a community-recognized organization that acts as stewards of the Open Source Definition (OSD) and also reviews and approves licenses as OSD-conformant. OSI has not yet responded to my inquiry about the legitimacy of the license, but I spoke with <a href=\"https://opentechstrategies.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Karl Fogel</a>, an open source specialist who consults with organizations on open source licensing and the implications of using it in business.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This so-called &#8216;Enhanced MIT&#8217; license is poorly drafted and internally inconsistent,&#8221; Fogel said. &#8220;I feel on safe ground in saying that were it ever submitted to the OSI for approval, it would be rejected quickly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fogel also commented on the inherent contradictions in the license&#8217;s introduction and permissions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An obvious internal inconsistency is that in the Introduction, it says that redistribution in source code format &#8216;must be done under the Enhanced MIT license and not under any other licenses, such as GPL,\'&#8221; Fogel said. &#8220;But then later, in point (2) of the conditional permissions grant, it says &#8216;when the Software is distributed as source code, the licensee is prohibited to change the license of the Software to any &#8216;viral&#8217; copyleft-type license, such as, inter alia: GPL, LGPL, EPL, MPL, etc.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So the Introduction is saying that redistribution is not permitted under <strong>any</strong> other open source license, but then the permissions grant section only bars redistribution under copyleft licenses, leaving open the possibility to distribute under other non-copyleft licenses. Which is it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to OSI, <a href=\"https://opensource.org/faq#copyleft\" target=\"_blank\">copyleft</a> &#8220;refers to licenses that allow derivative works but require them to use the same license as the original work.&#8221; In requiring the EMIT to be used for derivative works, the license adopts the viral nature Wix ostensibly wanted to avoid with the GPL. This emasculates the MIT, robbing it of its essential freedoms. For this reason and many others, the EMIT appears to be an illegitimate variant of the MIT.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A larger issue is that the reasoning in the Introduction about how the standard MIT license supposedly has a &#8216;bug&#8217; makes no sense,&#8221; Fogel said. &#8221; It asserts that redistribution under an open source copyleft license would somehow be more restrictive than not doing source redistribution at all (e.g., as with a standard proprietary license).  There is no sensible definition of the word &#8216;restrictive; in which releasing code under a copyleft license would restrict someone&#8217;s use of that code more than <em>not having the code in the first place</em> would restrict them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fogel does not think the EMIT is a valid derivative of the MIT license and is not convinced that it can be considered a license at all.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is very clear that a lawyer did not write this license,&#8221; Fogel said. &#8220;I think Abrahami must have written it himself. I hesitate to even call it a license; it&#8217;s not clear what a judge would do with it, except perhaps sell tickets.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Wix&#8217;s EMIT License is a Hostile Reaction to the Call for GPL Compliance</h3>\n<p>The EMIT license not only takes shots at the GPL but also injects a moral pronouncement against all those who subscribe to the tenets of copyleft licensing. The restrictions in the EMIT effectively &#8220;weaponize the license&#8221; against other open source projects, as one Reddit user said in a<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/5n7km9/wix_abandons_the_wordpress_editor_forks_original/\" target=\"_blank\">comment</a> on the situation. This encompasses a large portion of the open source community.</p>\n<p>Wix may not be able to publicly admit its violation of the GPL, as it has not yet answered for the past infringement of distributing the code in its mobile app. In looking back over the timeline of events, Wix&#8217;s public communication that implied it would comply with the GPL was disingenuous, as the team was scrambling behind the scenes to fork the original library and slap a new &#8220;anti-copyleft&#8221; license on it. The company has no respect for the GPL and, in fact, has communicated its disdain for the license in the language of its new EMIT license.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I remember reading this exchange when it happened,&#8221; Fogel said. &#8220;This is not a case of gray areas or &#8216;the truth lies somewhere in the middle.&#8217; Matt Mullenweg of WordPress is 100% right, and Wix CEO Avishai Abrahami is, quite simply, wrong. Mullenweg was extremely direct about what the problem was and how to fix it. Abrahami&#8217;s response was an evasive mishmash of brazen non sequiturs and willful refusal to acknowledge Mullenweg&#8217;s point, which was simply that if Wix is going to use WordPress code that is distributed under the GNU General Public License, then Wix has to follow the terms of the GPL like anyone else.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Abrahami&#8217;s poor behavior could only have been intentional,&#8221; Fogel said. &#8220;I just don&#8217;t see any other way to interpret it, given how easy to understand Mullenweg&#8217;s letter is, and how clear the issues are here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wix&#8217;s illegal use of GPL code in a proprietary app could easily be chalked up to ignorance or an oversight if the company had simply attempted to comply. Instead, they wrote a license that swipes back at copyleft proponents everywhere. The EMIT actually manages to trivialize both the GPL and the MIT in one fell swoop.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The GPL is not a disease,&#8221; said <a href=\"http://www.rosenlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lawrence Rosen</a> in a document titled <a href=\"http://www.rosenlaw.com/html/GPL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Unreasonable Fear of Infection</a>. &#8220;It is designed to satisfy certain philosophical and economic objectives that are widely shared by many members of the open source community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In writing its own &#8220;Enhanced&#8221; MIT license Wix has demonstrated a careless disregard for open source licensing and  hostility towards those who use copyleft licenses to guarantee user freedoms.</p>\n<p>Although some onlookers in the open source community disapproved of the two CEO&#8217;s handling the disagreement in open letters, there are plenty more who appreciate that the issue is being hammered out in public. Fogel said he hopes the situation &#8220;will draw some attention to the fact that the GPL actually means something and can be enforced.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 21 Jan 2017 00:04:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: Obama Foundation Launches New Website Powered by WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=65363\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/obama-foundation-launches-new-website-powered-by-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1987:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.obama.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Obama Foundation</a> launched its new WordPress-powered website today.

She&#8217;s spent the last two decades building things in and around the web, writes a <a href=\"http://www.jennybeaumont.com/subscribe/\">terrific newsletter</a>, and lives in France.</p>\n<p>One of the highlights of my year, and a fitting end to 2016 as my <a href=\"http://www.jennybeaumont.com/celebrating-15-years-of-freelancingwith-a-sabbatical/\">sabbatical</a> drew to a close, was attending the 2nd annual <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/photos-post-status-publish-wordcamp-us-2016/\">WordCamp US</a>, held December 2-4 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>The trip met my expectations in every way, from the warm-hearted nature of the locals to the super-sized portions at every delicious meal, and from the diversity of attendees to all of the extraordinary conversations I had during that short week I was in town.</p>\n<p>“You might have noticed that this year’s programming at WordCamp US had some more of a human side, in addition to just the technical that we’ve had before,” said Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of WordPress and CEO of Automattic, during his much-anticipated <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-state-word-2016/\">State of the Word</a>.</p>\n<p>“I think that a lot of our opportunities to grow over the coming year are on the human side, and understanding the humanity of an open source project and working together and creating the code that’s going to touch humanity as well.”</p>\n<p>Moving into 2017, ready for new opportunities and with the next edition of <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Europe</a> on the horizon, I find myself thinking about growth past and present, and about what success might look like for all of us in this new year.</p>\n<h3>Growth and competition for WordPress</h3>\n<p>“It’s really all about pie,” replied Mullenweg when asked about the future of a WordPress entrepreneur, stating that as long as the pie continues to grow, everyone can get a piece.</p>\n<p>He talked about how the new focuses of the WordPress project—the REST API, the Editor and the Customizer—along with an inclusive design-lead approach, should allow WordPress to reach new audiences.</p>\n<p>WordPress has seen incredible growth in recent years, now representing over <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all\">27% of websites</a>, a full 20% ahead of competing platforms. This translates to 58.5% market share of all monitored content management systems, <a href=\"https://www.rarst.net/wordpress/powers-internet/\">when looking</a> at the top 10 million sites.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean that the competition isn’t trying to close the gap. Mullenweg reported that the top proprietary platforms, such as Squarespace and Wix, spent upwards of 320 million in advertising dollars in 2016, often directly targeting search engine queries for WordPress.</p>\n<p>“I think that in the past WordPress got by on a lot of sort marketing by happenstance,” he said, admitting the need to look at the marketing of WordPress in new ways, and hopefully pooling the resources of the community to do so.</p>\n<p>“I think we have a real opportunity especially as the businesses around WordPress grow larger and larger, to actually coordinate a bit […] there’s no one company in the WordPress ecosystem that’s large enough to match 300 million dollars, and spend on telling people the WordPress story. But no one company needs to be large enough, because we’re a community.”</p>\n<p>All in all, he painted a bright picture for the future for the WordPress ecosystem, the community of people who come together around a common purpose and ideal—the WordPress project and its mission to democratize publishing—and in so doing create a new paradigm for work and the web, the byproduct of which is a flourishing economy.</p>\n<p>I can’t help but wonder, how big can the pie get? And while we concentrate on growth and competition, how do we measure the success of our mission? How will we know when we’ve democratized publishing? Can or should WordPress achieve this goal alone?</p>\n<h3>The numbers game for WordCamps</h3>\n<p>“We must tilt our hat and bow down to Europe, which beat us this year,” Mullenweg capitulated as he wrapped up his report on community growth, expressed in the number of events and event attendance worldwide.</p>\n<p>Growth is an indication that we’re doing something right. An increase in the numbers tells us that more people are interested and getting involved. This is what an open source project needs to reach a wider audience, stay competitive and accomplish its mission: people to make it happen.</p>\n<p>But should success be measured solely in numbers? Is it healthy to think that there can be winners and losers when it comes to the success of our community as a whole?</p>\n<p>In its first three years, WordCamp Europe grew at a slow and predictable rate. Then last year, for some reason, it exploded. We sold our initial batch of 1500 tickets practically overnight, and ended up selling nearly 2200 tickets in total.</p>\n<p>What happened? Did WordCamp Europe’s reputation catch up with itself, creating this burgeoning interest? Was Vienna simply an incredibly attractive destination for a lot of people? Or was it the organizing team that did an outstanding job at marketing and outreach?</p>\n<p>WordCamp US was in its second year, and we can ask similar questions about why they didn’t see the growth they were expecting. Is the event, with its transition from the long-standing WordCamp San Francisco, still in its infancy, so that slow growth is to be expected? Was going to the same destination two years in a row not as appealing to attendees? Did the team do an adequate job of communicating around the event?</p>\n<p>In my mind, both WordCamp Europe and WordCamp US were successful events. Each did a lot of things well, and some other things less well. Attendees I encountered, whether speakers, sponsors, volunteers or the general public, seemed to have a rewarding experience and their expectations met.</p>\n<p>Because that’s why we put these events on, right? Not to “get the numbers” or “win”, but to create an enriching experience.</p>\n<h3>Bigger is not necessarily better</h3>\n<p>So, how big do we let ourselves get? This has been an ongoing question for us on the WordCamp Europe team since things took on a new dimension in Vienna.</p>\n<p>When I asked <a href=\"https://paolo.blog/\">Paolo Belcastro</a>, WordCamp Europe local team lead in 2016 and global team lead for 2017, what he thought about growth he said, “For me a successful event is when we have one ticket left over. It should be our goal to make sure that everyone who wants to attend, can.”</p>\n<p>This is a philosophy that I stand beside. It reflects our focus on attendees and on inclusiveness, so that it doesn’t matter whether we have 1000, 2000 or 3000 people, it only matters that we do our best to accommodate everyone and put on a great event for however many show up.</p>\n<p>It does not, however, answer the question.</p>\n<p>It’s exciting to run a popular event, and it’s easy to get carried away with that excitement and sense of accomplishment knowing that so many people want to attend, that so many people are being impacted in positive ways. When we focus solely on the numbers, and adopt a “bigger is better” mentality, it’s also easy to lose sight of some important consequences of growth.</p>\n<h4>Professional level of production</h4>\n<p>Keep in mind that we didn’t originally plan an event for 2200 people last year, and so we had to improvise, which meant a significant budget increase and a lot of extra work for the organizing team.</p>\n<p>It also catapulted us into a new level of production. Putting on a large event is not the same as putting on a smaller one, and once you get up above 2000 attendees, it has a trickle down effect. It means organizing a speakers dinner for upwards of 300 volunteers, and an after party for 1500. These are events in and of themselves. We’re brought to collaborate with professionals in the events world—caterers, vendors, venues—while we’re still volunteers working in our “spare time”, some of us with more experience than others at making this all happen.</p>\n<h4>Increased cost of WordCamps</h4>\n<p>While the average ticket price per day has gone down, from $20 to $15.79, the cost of putting on a WordCamp has increased. Mullenweg reported that the cost of WordCamp US was $516 per person, while attendees continue to pay a mere $40 for entry to the two-day event, including lunch both days, free-flowing coffee, access to the contributor day and after party, not to mention the <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/photos-post-status-publish-wordcamp-us-2016/#jp-carousel-31176\">great swag</a>, which included both a t-shirt and an adorable Wapuu plushy this year.</p>\n<p>The additional 90% of this cost falls to sponsors. Sponsors are not volunteers running a non-profit, they are businesses. As we ask more and more of them, they understandably are <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-value-of-sponsoring-a-wordcamp-from-a-business-perspective\">starting to question</a> what they get in return. Our response has typically been, “you’re supporting the community and gaining exposure,” but is that enough and for how long? How much is too much to ask?</p>\n<h4>Setting expectations for sponsors and attendees</h4>\n<p>How much is too much to ask of anyone? As we ask more of sponsors they expect more in return. As we grow, try to predict growth and to outdo ourselves every year, the task for organizers becomes more demanding. As we create bigger and better events, attendees expect to find the same elsewhere.</p>\n<p>An event with 10,000 attendees would be amazing. We probably couldn’t call it a WordCamp, though. It would be a WordPalooza, and would require a full-time staff and a new approach to programming, sponsorship and organization on the whole. Does an event have to grow into order to be successful? Can maintaining a certain level of participation and quality also be considered a success?</p>\n<p>Because it’s also possible that WordCamp US and WordCamp Europe will simply plateau at a certain capacity. The world may not be ready for a WordPalooza.</p>\n<h3>Competition and success</h3>\n<p>“One of the reasons why I think WordPress has such a collaborative community, when you see competitors hanging out with each other and getting drinks […] is that it’s a growing pie. So everyone’s slice of that pie can grow alongside. If it were shrinking or a static pie, the only way to grow would be taking some pie from someone else.”</p>\n<p>Competition is widely considered good for business. It pushes companies to innovate and guard against complacency. It encourages a focus on customer service and helps protect consumers through competitive pricing. Competition in the marketplace confirms there is a market to be had, that demand is strong for the products or services being offered. It seeks to establish a basis for fairness, while letting companies vie for market share, sales and profit margins.</p>\n<p>The friendly, collaborative nature of the WordPress community is born out of the open source philosophy of contribution and sharing. It is, in my mind, our greatest strength. Support within the community is unparalleled. We consistently root for one another, learn from one another, share our triumphs and our difficulties, through mergers, acquisitions, hirings, firings, career changes and even the occasional drama.</p>\n<p>How big can WordPress get? Arriving at 100% market share is neither a likely nor a desirable scenario, if you believe in the benefits of competition and fair trade. The pie is not likely to grow exponentially, but rather will turn into something else entirely as the technology, the world and the web evolve, and the project along with them.</p>\n<h3>Success and expectations</h3>\n<p>“When we are candid about our shortcoming, it allows us to be better towards going to the future,” Mullenweg said in talking about the WordPress Editor.</p>\n<p>This is a sentiment we can apply across the board, to ensure that our philosophy and our mission are reflected in our words and actions as we bring new users to our platform and welcome newcomers to our community.</p>\n<p>Healthy competition, whether inside or outside of the community, helps us strive to be the best we can be. Raising the bar can produce some extraordinary results, allowing us to be inspired by one another, taking on ideas that we might find valuable for our audiences, customers, clients. Healthy competition allows us to learn, have fun, grow and share that wealth of knowledge around us.</p>\n<p>Unhealthy competition causes us to lose sight of our goals, focusing on numbers instead of the people affected by them. In a community such as ours that prides itself on inclusiveness, we can only succeed or fail together.</p>\n<p>In this coming year I’d like to see success shaped through managing expectations and staying true to our purpose. I’d like to see it shaped by people, not numbers, by the humanity of this open source project that brings us together, allows us to create, to innovate, to provide for ourselves and our families.</p>\n<p>I’d like to think that a future vision of success could be when growth is neither the goal, nor our limitation, when we’re no longer looking to a growing pie, but rather to a renewable spring or self-sustaining garden. I’d like to think that one day we will be able to say that we’ve succeeded in democratizing publishing, and if and when we do, I doubt that we will have done it alone. And that’s a good thing.</p>\n<h3>See you in Paris</h3>\n<p>I have no idea how many people will show up to WordCamp Europe in June, but I do know that it will be another fantastic event. I also know that you can help make it a success by participating.

One of the most intriguing new features announced in this release, however, is the integration with <a href=\"https://wordads.co/\" target=\"_blank\">WordAds</a>, WordPress.com&#8217;s advertising program.</p>\n<p>Jetpack users are required to be on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/jetpack/connect/premium\" target=\"_blank\">Premium plan</a> ($9.00/month or $99/year) in order to sign on with WordAds. The feature is then available within the Engagement tab along with settings for adjusting ad placement.</p>\n<p>Eligibility for WordAds was previously limited to sites that had thousands of page views per month, but this requirement is lifted for those who have purchased a Premium or Professional Jetpack plan. Unlike Adsense, which pays for clicks, WordAds pays based on the number of impressions combined with many other factors. According to Derek Springer, an Automattic employee who has worked on WordAds for several years, the traffic requirement was given to set earnings expectations and to ensure support resources were adequately available.</p>\n<h3>How Much Can Publishers Earn through WordAds?</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to to gauge how much a publisher can earn using WordAds, and Automattic doesn&#8217;t publish any sample earnings. The WordAds network has <a href=\"https://wordads.co/2016/10/14/google-adsense-facebook-ads-and-dozens-more-buying-from-wordads/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 60 partners</a> bidding for advertising space in realtime, including Google&#8217;s AdSense, Google, AdX, Facebook Ads, AOL, Yahoo, and Amazon. <a href=\"https://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/wordads/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com&#8217;s Daily Post blog</a> likened the network to a stock market with prices rising and falling as available space changes.</p>\n<p>When asked about the average return for every 1,000 impressions, Derek Springer said it&#8217;s challenging to estimate due to the complex set of factors influencing the revenue publishers can earn. These include location and number of ads, geography of viewer, percentage of viewers with ad blockers, and other factors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Generally speaking, a site with majority US views with high-quality content can expect to earn the most, while non-English language, low-quality (copied content, nsfw, spam, purchased traffic) sites can expect to earn very little (if anything),&#8221; Springer said. &#8220;Our network over the past year or so has gotten pretty good at appropriately rewarding high-quality sites with high-quality traffic (and penalizing the inverse).&#8221;</p>\n<p>For years, bloggers have traded stats and earning records, speculating on what influences WordAds&#8217; unpredictable payouts. In 2014, the Human Breed Blog <a href=\"https://humanbreeds.com/2014/10/13/wordads-advertising-on-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> a collection of data from blogs that made their WordAds earnings publicly available. The data demonstrated inconsistency in earnings for many publishers, including the author&#8217;s own blog, where earnings varied wildly from 2014-2015:</p>\n<blockquote><p>My earnings have dropped down to half (From $22.55 in October 2014 to $11.77 in May 2015) despite my page views being higher than 20,000 views per month. The return per 1,000 Ad Impression (CPM) has dropped from $2.25 in October 2014 to $1.17 in May 2015 and the return per 1,000 Page views (CPV) has dropped from $1.39 in October 2014 to $0.51 in May 2015.</p></blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-human-breed-blog-wordads-earnings.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>The Human Breed Blog 2014-2015 WordAds Earnings\n<p>This example is representative of the experience of many WordAds publishers in 2014-2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On my blog SQLwithManoj.com, for the months May, June, and July, the &#8216;Ad Impressions&#8217; were around ~10k and earnings were in the range of $25 to $48 respectively each month,&#8221; <a href=\"https://humanbreeds.com/2014/10/13/wordads-advertising-on-wordpress/#comment-4468\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Manoj Pandey, blogger at SQLwithManoj.com. &#8220;But in the month of August the &#8216;Ad Impressions&#8217; were showing ~100k, i.e. ~10 times the previous months, but earnings are still in the same range.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For many publishers participating in WordAds, there seems to be little correlation between impressions and payouts from month to month. Numerous publishers have reported progressively lower earnings despite having higher traffic numbers than previous months. Clarissa&#8217;s Blog, included in the collection of public earnings above, <a href=\"https://clarissasblog.com/2016/01/30/wordad-earnings-an-important-update/\" target=\"_blank\">published stats</a> from June 2014 to December 2015 that show a dramatic decrease in the amount paid for impressions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You have no way of knowing where the &#8216;ad impressions&#8217; figure comes from and why it varies from one month to another,&#8221; Clarissa said. &#8220;You will have to trust WordPress on that. I experimented with placing the maximum amount of ads as opposed to a moderate amount of ads and that had absolutely no impact on the number of ad impressions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Things started changing in 2016 for Clarissa who now <a href=\"https://clarissasblog.com/2016/01/30/wordad-earnings-an-important-update/#comment-289600\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that earnings are increasing. &#8220;I have no idea why but the payments seem to have returned to the higher rates,&#8221; Clarissa said. &#8220;Right now is a good time to do WordAds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Others continue to <a href=\"https://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/is-wordads-on-decline?replies=3#post-2842453\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> declines on the WordPress.com forums as recently as this week.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I used to get $800 for 800K impressions,&#8221; said the owner of rebirthonlineworld.com. &#8220;A few months ago I got $100 for more than 2 million impressions. Last month, only $90 for 500K impressions. This is a big problem for me.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordAds Vastly Overpaid for Low-Quality Traffic During Its First Years</h3>\n<p>In 2013 WordAds paid out $1 million to publishers on its network. According to Derek Springer, earnings since then have been &#8220;pretty flat the past year&#8221; due to industry-wide declining ad rates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve been slowly clawing our way back from the trough of early 2015, which was a historical low for us,&#8221; Springer said. &#8220;So more folks were paid out, but rates as a whole were at their lowest point in 2015. We’ve been steadily increasing our rates and paying out less to low-quality content/traffic, so if you’re a high quality site it’s likely your rates haven’t fallen too much.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, WordAds was quietly evolving its network to better distinguish sites that would deliver more value to its advertising partners, which accounts for many of the dramatic declines in earnings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pre-<a href=\"https://wordads.co/2015/11/02/introducing-wordads-2-0/\" target=\"_blank\">WordAds 2.0</a> our network didn&#8217;t have the precision to distinguish between high-quality and low-quality (spam, nsfw, bot views, etc) traffic and we had to make some coarse estimations on how to chop the earnings value up,&#8221; Springer said. &#8220;The net effect was that we vastly overpaid low-quality traffic for the first handful of years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since WordAds 2.0 the program is gotten better at paying users for high-quality content and traffic. The team has more information on the traffic the network is getting and buyers have more information about the content they are bidding on.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The net effect is that advertisers refuse to bid on low-quality content and traffic and those sites that were previously earning lots are now getting pennies on the dollar,&#8221; Springer said. &#8220;I would estimate that after investigation 95% of the time the folks complaining about low payout have something kinda scammy going on, usually copied content or paid traffic (and frequently both).&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Paid traffic&#8221; in this instance refers to users who have paid a service to send bots to a page to refresh constantly in order to artificially inflate pageviews. One recent highly publicized incident of this kind of fraud is a case where <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-hackers-stole-millions-from-video-advertisers-ad-fraud-company-says-1482272717\" target=\"_blank\">Russian hackers stole more than $3 million per day from video advertisers</a> using nonhuman bot traffic. Similar tactics have been used on WordAds, motivated by a misconception that pageviews are equal to ad views.</p>\n<h3>The Decline of the Advertising Industry</h3>\n<p>Another factor contributing to lower earnings over the past few years is the general decline of the advertising industry. A 2015 <a href=\"http://www.cjr.org/analysis/reuters_digital_news_report.php\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters Institute Digital News survey</a> indicates that nearly half of US internet users have some form of ad blocking software installed. Reuters Institute&#8217;s latest predictions <a href=\"http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/publications/2017/journalism-media-technology-predictions-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">forecast a 24% increase</a> in US users with ad blocking in 2017. Advertisers have to fight harder to get the attention of the remaining half of consumers and many companies have decided to allocate those funds elsewhere.</p>\n<p>According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau&#8217;s latest Internet Advertising Revenue report, <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/digital/iab-digital-ad-revenue-breaks-record/306557/\" target=\"_blank\">search advertising on desktop declined for the first time in 2016</a>, falling 12% to $8.9 billion. However, mobile advertising grew 105% from $3.6 billion to $7.4 billion. Mobile search is having an increasingly strong impact in shaping a site&#8217;s traffic.</p>\n<p>These factors are outside of WordAds&#8217; control but they weigh heavily on how many impressions publishers will receive. If the vast majority of a site&#8217;s visitors are using ad-blockers and the site isn&#8217;t easily found via mobile search, it is likely to suffer earning declines on any ad network.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ad rates industry wide have fallen over the past few years,&#8221; Springer said. &#8220;Ad buyers just aren&#8217;t paying what they used to and more users are using ad blockers. They heyday of the late aughts/early twenty-teens may never return as ad buyers realized they just aren&#8217;t getting the return they were expecting.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordAds Needs More Transparency Around Partners and Reporting</h3>\n<p>It is difficult for publishers to improve their strategies for generating ad revenue when earnings fluctuate wildly without any explanation beyond changes in advertising rates. After reviewing the product&#8217;s forums, many are requesting more transparency around why their earnings have dropped despite higher numbers of impressions. They want to know if advertising rates have dropped for the month, if partners have dropped out of the network, or if their content failed to connect with visitors on certain days.</p>\n<p>WordAds users have experienced <a href=\"https://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/earnings-from-wordads-account?replies=111\" target=\"_blank\">problems</a> with incorrect reporting, record low payouts, and blank banner displays. In the past there have also been considerable delays in publishers receiving their monthly earnings. Springer said improving the reporting process is a top priority for the team this year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The flip-side/challenge of working with dozens of networks is that none of them pay us very consistently,&#8221; Springer said. &#8220;In the past there was no unified collection process on our end, so we would have to wait to collect from each partner and then split it up and send folks earnings out in one batch. However, for the past year and a half or so we&#8217;ve been working with a company called <a href=\"http://www.iponweb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">IPONWEB</a> to unify our earnings, reporting, and ad buying process (this is what powers WordAds 2.0). We&#8217;re at the point where we can begin to provide closer to real-time earnings reporting.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Automattic is Optimistic about Expanding the <br />WordAds Program with Jetpack</h3>\n<p>The number of WordAds sites are up 111% year over year. WordAds currently has a few thousand self-hosted sites running <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/radcontrol/\" target=\"_blank\">AdControl/Jetpack Ads</a> and Springer said the team is expecting that number to grow considerably now that integration has been added to Jetpack. The AdControl plugin is still available for non-Premium Jetpack users but the standard application and traffic requirements apply. Springer said they plan to phase out the plugin at some point in the future but there are no definite plans yet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tens of thousands of WP.com sites are approved WordAds (meaning they applied and were approved) out of many tens of thousands more total applications,&#8221; Springer said. &#8220;Additionally, every freemium WordPress.com site is running our ad network, though we naturally keep all the revenue from those sites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a gaggle of new publishers joining WordAds through Jetpack, one might imagine that rates and payouts for existing users would decrease as more advertising space becomes available. However, this isn&#8217;t how advertising networks work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Generally speaking, advertisers want to display more ads than most publishers are able to provide (known as inventory), so adding more publishers/inventory to a network is a net benefit to advertisers and is what attracts the bigger, higher paying ad buyers,&#8221; Springer said. &#8220;If we can tell our ad partners &#8216;We have 10,000,000,000 pageviews available this month across our network,&#8221; then that attracts much more lucrative buyers than if a user has to try to attract them on their own. Advertisers also like that they can cut one deal for a million sites as opposed to having to cut them piecemeal and are generally willing to give us better deals. The whole &#8216;powers 27% of the web&#8217; is a pretty tasty morsel for ad networks.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Advice for Publishers New to WordAds: Keep Expectations Realistic</h3>\n<p>Seamless advertising is a major incentive for Jetpack users to sign up for the Premium plan, which also includes backups, one-click restores, security scanning, and 13GB video storage. The prospect of being able to flip the switch to turn on ads and potentially start earning money is very compelling, especially for users who have struggled with other forms of advertising that were not WordPress-compatible.</p>\n<p>The general outlook for WordAds is improving, as the product has evolved to reward higher quality content. As advertisers receive a better return on their investments, their confidence in bidding should increase. However, most publishers should expect to see fluctuations on earnings.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s <a href=\"https://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/wordads/\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Post Blog</a> advises new publishers to temper their expectations with the knowledge that they would need &#8220;hundreds of thousands of pageviews to generate meaningful earnings.&#8221; For most average bloggers, the ad revenue may not buy more than a decent cup of coffee.</p>\n<p>Mortiz Linder, an owner of traveluxblog.com, <a href=\"https://traveluxblog.com/2016/10/29/my-experience-with-wordads/\" target=\"_blank\">published his earnings</a> and described his experience as &#8220;rather average.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice idea to gain something without effort, to get at least something back for all the work we put into traveluxblog each day,&#8221; Moritz said.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 01:40:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 260 – SiteGround, Affiliate Summit Recap, and New Security Czar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=65327&preview=true&preview_id=65327\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-260-siteground-affiliate-summit-recap-and-new-security-czar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2802:\"<p>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, <a href=\"http://www.marcuscouch.com/\">Marcus Couch</a> recaps his trip to Affiliate Summit 2017 held in Las Vegas, Nevada last weekend.

I didn’t see it as such right away. Looking at the last 4 years of my life, I can fully appreciate its impact.</p>\n<p>Aspiring to a life full of adventures and whimsy; I never really fit the mold. American TV series and movies that taught me my dreams could be achieved if I worked hard enough. Armed with that knowledge (and without a fancy diploma to my name), I worked bank, police, IT, supply chain jobs until I discovered the joy of making websites.</p>\n<p>My newfound passion (and many sleepless nights of work) helped me become a webdesigner. At the time, Joomla!, Spip and Typo 3 were the big names out there (in France). After achieving the role of Artistic Director as a freelancer; it took me a few years to open my own web agency. That moment changed my thinking: it was no longer ME but WE. And when a client asked us to use WordPress, we got to experience the CMS and its community.</p>\n<h3>Focusing on WordPress</h3>\n<p>Our team quickly realized that WordPress could do much more than “just blogs”. In France, the CMS kept having a reputation as a blog only platform. Complex websites were not made in WordPress. Our agency decided to convince clients otherwise. To achieve our mission and hone our skills, we decided to get closer to the WordPress community. I naively offered my help in evangelization efforts to the Paris WordCamp organizers. Except that there was one clear hurdle in our path: we had never contributed anything to the community before! This meant that we were relatively unknown. Needless to say that the feedback we received wasn’t what we expected.</p>\n<h3>Contributions: It’s About Helping Others</h3>\n<p>Contributing meant one thing: bring something to the WordPress ecosystem to help improve it. The WordCamp association’s president asked us to answer questions on the French forum as a token of our goodwill, to show our commitment.</p>\n<p>I started to answer questions right away but felt like an imposter. All the questions on the forum seemed so technical. I didn’t know how to contribute since I wasn’t a developer. It wasn’t like I was going to create a theme or plugin anytime soon. I kept obsessing over ways I could provide value to the community. I thought about my skills but couldn’t come up with something that would make a real difference.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sure I could speak English, but translating documents was not something I felt comfortable doing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So I turned to the previous WordCamp Paris conference and took a closer look at the participants. There, I found my first clue: a marketing expert! I reached out to him to see if I could interview him. As Marketing Director of a press group, he had lead a big WordPress project for his company. Interviewing him brought me two things: an article for our blog discussing what could be done with WordPress and a solid understanding of how the inner workings of the French WordPress community. He gave me an idea of the path one would take to end up giving a conference at the WordCamp. I didn’t realize it at the time, but by picking a name on a conference program, I would meet one of the key players in my WordPress story: Benjamin.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I continued to write articles about projects made with WordPress, sometimes ours, sometimes the competition’s. Good WordPress knows no bounds so it was necessary for me to showcase all the amazing websites made with this CMS. It’s also how I discovered my main competitors (before meeting them in the flesh later at various events).</p>\n<p>A white paper detailing the success of WordPress as a CMS got my name out. This allowed me to gain the courage to pitch my first conference. Providing feedback on projects allowed me to find my place in the WordPress community. Focusing on my experience and helping others didn’t require developer skills. My contribution was in writing and not in coding.</p>\n<h3>My First WordPress Conference As A Speaker</h3>\n<p>My first conference topic was on how to create a multilingual, multi-site project with WordPress in 3 months. Needless to say that I was nervous. I mean, speaking in front of 300 people is not something I had done while working at a bank, or in the police force or in any other job really. Adventure: here I come!</p>\n<blockquote><p>The WordPress community was very kind to me and my first conference experience was a memorable one.</p></blockquote>\n<p>During this conference, I wanted to highlight the plugins we used for this project. I mentioned a French startup that had launched a premium plugin as its first product. I found their approach interesting, so I thought I would give them a little visibility. Showcasing good WordPress websites, themes and plugins was already a habit of mine by then. The French team were happy to be mentioned and happened to be present at the event. They came to talk to me after my conference. Turns out, we had a lot to talk about. The company’s name: WP Media. They would open a new chapter of my WordPress story.</p>\n<p>During the closing night, I also met a lot of people. Some of them, just like Benjamin were going to have a big impact on my life. Many became great friends as well as mentors like Jenny Beaumont.</p>\n<p>Once I got started, there was no stopping me! I continued to speak at events (WordCamp Lyon, WP Tech Nantes), attended meetups, continued writing articles to highlight WordPress projects.</p>\n<p>The following year, I joined the organizing team of WordCamp Paris.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I go to my first WordCamp Europe which was a major new turn.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Europe 2014 Changed My Life</h3>\n<p>Going to the WordCamp Europe changed my life. It’s an experience I highly recommend. If you can, go to the next WordCamp Europe!</p>\n<p>The organizers managed to pack so many international speakers that my head was spinning. Speakers were coming from all over the world. The quality of the talks (and speakers) along with the breadth of subjects covered open so many possibilities. You could end up changing your approach to WordPress or finding a new method of working with your peers.</p>\n<p>I attended a conference by Noel Tock named Beyond the code where he explained how he managed his life working in remote while traveling at the same time. He also gave insights as to how to monitor your time and how to optimize it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Realizing that such a life was possible; that you could achieve this time of freedom by reclaiming your time was a massive discovery.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The second eye-opening conference for me was Simon&#8217;s lecture on Running an open source. He explained that that undertaking Open Source also meant contributing and collaborating with a community, including your competitors. Simon showed us for 30 minutes that working with competitors was not only beneficial for us agencies, but also for the customer, and for the WordPress community as a whole.</p>\n<h3>Professional WordPress</h3>\n<p>Becoming a strong voice in the professionalisation of WordPress in France and encouraging web agencies to contribute and to exchange more had become priority subjects.</p>\n<p>I have launched a WP Next association for professionals</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To ensure the promotion of WordPress, mainly with professionals, managers of information system, internet director, new media, &#8230; and more generally all IT decision makers.</li>\n<li>To enhance the skills of WordPress professionals with decision-makers,</li>\n<li>Promote French know-how around the WordPress CMS, associated technologies and services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also launched with Deborah Donnier a documentary project Think WP to make known WordPress and its community.</p>\n<h3>A new turn</h3>\n<p>With these activities I gradually moved away from the creation of websites. Having so many opportunities tied to WordPress available to me, I decided to take a new turn. During the Wordcamps across Europe, I took great pleasure in exchanging with WP Media. We had kept contact since our first meeting. My profile and experience seemed to like a great fit for a new role in the WP Media adventure. I took a leap and became COO of the startup about a year ago. I manage my agency in parallel.</p>\n<p>I now work 100% remotely and so does a great portion of my agency. As for WP Media, everyone works remotely. Being a remote worker frees me from constraints that are inherent when you live in the Paris region (it’s a city and province in France).

To use it, copy the code and add it to a custom WordPress plugin or paste it to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file. I added the code to the top of my theme&#8217;s functions.php file.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CodeSnippetInThemeFunctionsPHPFile.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Code Snippet at the Top of my Theme&#8217;s Functions.php File\n<p>The JavaScript portion of the snippet adds a new item to the Bulk Actions drown-down menu named Add to BP Group.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AddToBPGroup.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Add to BP Group Bulk Action Menu Item\n<p>Select the users you want to add to a group and select Add to BP Group.

I tested this theory by moving nearly 400 registered users at the same time to a new BuddyPress group and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues. Keep in mind that the site I&#8217;m working on is relatively new, is running WordPress 4.7, and has very little traffic which could explain why I didn&#8217;t have a problem.</p>\n<p>Being able to manage BuddyPress groups in bulk should be a core feature.

The company has also begun issuing and installing certificates on new accounts automatically after customers register domains or direct new domains to SiteGround&#8217;s servers. This also includes add-on domains added in cPanel. The certificates are also auto-renewed as long as the domains are pointed to the host&#8217;s servers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since the launch of Let’s Encrypt our customers have installed nearly 40,000 such certificates,&#8221; said Hristo Pandjarov, WordPress specialist at SiteGround. &#8220;This is less than 10% of the 500,000 domains we host. Together with the paid certificates we may say that 15% of the domains we host were using the HTTPS protocol before we started the auto-issuing procedure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>SiteGround is a sponsor of Let&#8217;s Encrypt and one of the first to auto-issue certificates to self-hosted WordPress customers. Let&#8217;s Encrypt <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/lets-encrypt-passes-20-million-active-certificates-in-2016\" target=\"_blank\">passed 20 million active certificates in 2016</a> and the pressure is on for more sites to adopt SSL in 2017 with Google marking insecure sites in Chrome and using HTTPS as a ranking signal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What prompted this decision is that we truly believe HTTPS is the future standard for web protocol and we also believe it is the better protocol,&#8221; Pandjarov said. &#8220;This is a good enough motivation for us to take the step of installing it automatically. We have decided to automate the SSL issuance and setup almost right after the appearance of the Let’s Encrypt initiative. Matt Mullenweg’s statement at WordCamp US that issuing SSL certificates will be a very important factor in evaluating a web host, was one more validation that this planned automation was a decision in the right direction.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Pandjarov, the vast majority of SiteGround&#8217;s customers are running WordPress. Respondents to the company&#8217;s 2016 client survey indicated that more than two thirds of them use WordPress, which Pandjarov said is a 10% increase in the popularity of WordPress among SiteGround users.</p>\n<h3>Next Step for SiteGround: Pre-Configuring WordPress Installs to Use SSL with One Click </h3>\n<p>Auto-issuing certificates does not guarantee that SiteGround customers will jump through the hoops to configure their sites to use the certificates. Installing a certificate on an existing WordPress site is not as straightforward as a simple click in most cases. SiteGround is working on fully automating this process for its WordPress customers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we really want to get closer to 100% HTTPS usage, we need to do more than just automatically issue the certificate,&#8221; Pandjarov said. &#8220;Our next step is to provide a way to pre-configure an active WordPress site, hosted on our servers, to work with the already issued SSL with one click. Additionally, our auto-installer is being updated to install all new WordPress sites as https-ready.&#8221;</p>\n<p>SiteGround doesn&#8217;t yet have an ETA for one-click SSL configuration but Pandjarov said the announcement will be coming soon.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 21:52:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: Postmatic Basic Rebrands as Replyable, Moves Two-Way Email Commenting to SaaS Product\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=65245\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://wptavern.com/postmatic-basic-rebrands-as-replyable-moves-two-way-email-commenting-to-saas-product\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5935:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/replyable.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Postmatic is rebranding its WordPress.org <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/postmatic/\" target=\"_blank\">Postmatic Basic</a> plugin as Replyable and pushing the two-way email commenting feature into <a href=\"https://replyable.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a new SaaS product</a>. After discovering that many users simply want email commenting, without additional post delivery and newsletter features, Postmatic launched <a href=\"https://replyable.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Replyable</a> to offer this starting at $3/month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Replyable was born out of user feedback,&#8221; founder Jason Lemieux said. &#8220;Postmatic does more than most sites need and the price is squarely mid-market. From the beginning we’ve heard from users that they already use another newsletter service and just want Postmatic to handle comment subscriptions &#8211; but that alone isn’t worth $20 to too many people. With Replyable we can offer it for $3.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lemieux and his team have now transitioned Postmatic to be purely a Saas product without a presence in the WordPress.org directory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Postmatic will continue to grow as a complete engagement system and, if anything, become even more complex and go further up market,&#8221; Lemieux said. &#8220;Sites which use Postmatic tend to dive in deeply. It is meant to function as a package. Grow a list, deliver to it, get them talking about your ideas, monetize the results.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/postmatic/\" target=\"_blank\">Replyable plugin on WordPress.org</a> now simply covers comment subscriptions with all other features available in the commercial products.</p>\n<p>Ripping an existing feature out of a free plugin and making it paid is fairly unusual and can have a negative impact on how users perceive the plugin. However, Postmatic has a plan to allow legacy users to continue using the features they had before by switching to <a href=\"http://docs.replyable.com/article/284-switching-from-postmatic-basic-to-replyable\" target=\"_blank\">Postmatic Labs</a>. It&#8217;s an inconvenient change but is required for those who don&#8217;t want to upgrade to a commercial plan.</p>\n<p>Although WordPress.org says Postmatic has approximately 1,000 active installs, Lemieux estimates there are 8,000 users including those using the commercial plugin or the Labs plugin. He would not share any specific revenue figures but said he learned some important pricing lessons in leading the bootstrapped startup for the past two years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We aren’t a runaway WordPress success story but we’re alive and loving our jobs,&#8221; Lemieux said. &#8220;About six months ago it became apparent that we needed to get out of the mid market. We had a huge group of people saying, &#8216;I just want email commenting and will totally pay you 5 bucks a month for it,&#8217; and another group saying, &#8216;We pay $6,000 a month sending Mailchimp RSS campaigns but yours are better for only $1500. Why so cheap?&#8217; That’s been a frustrating reality and a big lesson in knowing your audience and pricing appropriately.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Next on Postmatic&#8217;s Roadmap: Epoch 2</h3>\n<p>In July 2015, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/postmatic-brings-100-realtime-commenting-to-wordpress-with-epoch-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">Postmatic introduced Epoch</a> as a Disqus alternative, offering 100% realtime commenting for WordPress. The plugin submits comments via AJAX so that they appear instantly without refreshing the page. Lemieux and the team have been working on the second version for nearly a year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Epoch 2 is a huge step forward,&#8221; Lemieux said. &#8220;We built it on top of the REST API and Angular. It’s fast and incredibly light. Commenting isn’t sexy &#8211; I don’t think it will ever be, but comments are great for SEO, community, and for building brands and authority. Comments aren’t going away. In fact, they are vitally important to keeping the web as a place for discourse, conversation, and the sharing of ideas. We need to continue to make them a better experience. Epoch isn’t groundbreaking in its functionality but it does the job of making sure sites of any size can still run native WordPress comments.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Postmatic continues to innovate with native comments, an aspect of WordPress that doesn&#8217;t have as many commercial players as something like forms or e-commerce. Lemieux attributes this underserved area to the poor reputation of previous non-native solutions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it is because of the rise and fall of third party commenting system,&#8221; Lemieux said. &#8220;Early in WordPress history services like Disqus and Livefyre grabbed huge parts of the comment traffic on WordPress sites by offering more features, better speed, and improved moderation tools (with the hidden cost of selling your users down the river). It was certainly a siren song. But most all of them stagnated, violated user trust, or just plain didn’t work well. And commenting got a bad name. Naturally came the trend in disabling comments and, well, now here we are and people are trying to have conversations 140 characters at a time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lemieux said the innovation he sees happening outside WordPress makes him believe that comments can overcome their past reputation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Things are getting better &#8211; and hopefully more folks will begin to innovate,&#8221; Lemieux said. &#8220;Lucky for us other blogging and publishing platforms are innovating and coming up with interesting ideas all the time. Some of them, like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/inline-comments/\" target=\"_blank\">inline commenting</a> from Medium, do make their way back over to WordPress. That makes me optimistic.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 15:49:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: Aaron D.

The role was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/short-interview-with-nikolay-bachiyski-wordpress-security-czar\">created in 2015</a> to provide more structure and focus around incident responses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The responsibilities of the position include, organizing the security team and making sure all security concerns and reports get triaged and ultimately fixed, coordinating the security side of releases, and being a point of contact for any security related things that need one,&#8221; Campbell said.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg, co-creator of the WordPress project, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/01/09/aaron-campbell-leading-security/\">thanked Bachiyski</a> for being the first to accept the role and putting the foundation in place for future team leads, &#8220;This is also a good time to thank the dozens of volunteers who participate in the security group, and the researchers and reporters who bring issues to our attention,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Campbell says he plans to finish what Bachiyski started by getting WordPress.org onto HackerOne. &#8220;Nikolay did a lot of work around expanding our team as well as getting the foundation laid for moving over to <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/\">HackerOne</a>,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t quite ready to make the move completely, but I hope to phase out the security@ E-Mail address in favor of HackerOne in the near future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In late 2016, GoDaddy <a href=\"https://aarondcampbell.com/2016/09/joining-godaddy-as-a-full-time-wordpress-core-contributor/\">hired Campbell</a> to contribute to WordPress core full-time. The company continues to back his involvement in WordPress, &#8220;The role is completely voluntary,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;GoDaddy has truly been extremely hands off while funding me to do all this, and I&#8217;m grateful to have that continue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you think you&#8217;ve discovered a security vulnerability with the self-hosted version of WordPress, you&#8217;re encouraged to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/\">responsibly disclose</a> it to the security team by emailing security @ wordpress.org and include as much detail as possible.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 14 Jan 2017 23:53:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: Automattic Releases Free Plugin for Exporting Photos from Lightroom to WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=65177\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-releases-free-plugin-for-exporting-photos-from-lightroom-to-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2493:\"<p>Yesterday Automattic <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/01/12/wordpress-com-lightroom/\" target=\"_blank\">released</a> a new free plugin the makes it easy for Lightroom users to export their photos to WordPress. <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lightroom</a> is an Adobe product for managing and editing photos, and the plugin works with the software on MacOS and Windows. It is compatible with both WordPress.com and Jetpack-powered sites.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/lightroom/\" target=\"_blank\">Lightroom plugin</a> requires a WordPress.com account to install. Users can then select photos in Lightroom and export them to a WordPress site with all the standard settings available, such as image resizing, watermarking, output sharpening, and more. The plugin automatically exports titles and captions. A large number of photos can take awhile to export, but once the upload is finished users can find their images in the WordPress media library.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wp-lightroom.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>When asked for tips on suggested upload size and compression, Automattic representative John Godley said, &#8220;WordPress.com can handle pretty much anything you throw at it! I personally go for a high quality and large size so it looks good on a HiDPI screen, and then let WordPress resize as necessary to fit the viewers device.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear how the release of Automattic&#8217;s free plugin will affect the commercial products that exist for a similar purpose. <a href=\"https://flothemes.com/flo-plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">FloLight</a>, <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/wplr-sync/buy/\" target=\"_blank\">WPLR Sync</a>, and other solutions will need to offer more features with a quicker setup if they want to compete with the new free Lightroom plugin.</p>\n<p>Those who want to use the plugin must already have a Lightroom license (standalone or subscription). Although this is a relatively small subset of overall WordPress users, it saves a great deal of time for photobloggers and those who process a large number of photos with Lightroom before posting online. For most, this <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/lightroom/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a> simplifies what was previously a tedious, multi-step process of manually uploading the photos after working with them in Lightroom.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 14 Jan 2017 00:13:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: Wes Bos Launches JavaScript30, a Free 30-Day Vanilla JS Coding Course\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=65209\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/wes-bos-launches-javascript30-a-free-30-day-vanilla-js-coding-course\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2601:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/javascript30.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>For those who failed to &#8220;learn JavaScript deeply&#8221; last year, 2017 offers a clean slate for restarting your JavaScript learning goals. <a href=\"http://wesbos.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wes Bos</a>, a developer and educator known for his high quality video tutorials, recently launched a free 30-day vanilla JS coding challenge course that provides structure for developing a new habit of daily learning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://javascript30.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript30</a> walks users through building 30 things in 30 days with no frameworks, no compilers, no libraries, and no boilerplate.

Build things. Lots of things. Build 1,000 things. Keep it up and don&#8217;t stop.&#8221; The course is packed full of quick, interesting, and practical projects.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/javascript30-lessons.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>JavaScript30 includes access to 30 videos, 30 days of starter files, and completed HTML, CSS, and JS Solutions for each day.

Fogel, a partner at <a href=\"https://opentechstrategies.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Tech Strategies</a> and OSS contributor since 1997, was a founding developer in the Subversion project. He has worked for more than a decade as an open source specialist, helping businesses and organizations evaluate, launch, and manage open source projects.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://producingoss.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Producing Open Source Software</a> version 2 was released for free this week under the Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license. The first edition was published in 2005 but the landscape of OSS has changed drastically over the past 12 years. In 2013, Fogel <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kfogel/updating-producing-open-source-software-for-2nd-ed/description\" target=\"_blank\">successfully raised $15,376</a> towards his $10,000 Kickstarter goal to fund the revision.</p>\n<p>The book includes topics like &#8216;Free&#8217; Versus &#8216;Open Source,&#8217; choosing a license, version control, social and political infrastructure, the economics of open source, culture, and communication. It was written for managers and software developers but can also be informative for newcomers to open source projects.</p>\n<p>Fogel originally planned on finishing the second edition by the end of 2013 but experienced delays due to starting his company. Some chapters also took longer to revise than he anticipated.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In retrospect, if I had understood what the pressures of a young and growing company would be, I would not have started the 2nd edition when I did,&#8221; Fogel said. &#8220;It has been a lesson.&#8221; Fortunately, for the 314 Kickstarter backers  who might have been waiting on his work for four years, progress was immediately available in the public repository for the book. Fogel didn&#8217;t keep any private version of the book elsewhere.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While there are substantial changes throughout the book, the most expanded chapter is probably Chapter 5, &#8216;Participating as a Business, Non-Profit, or Government Agency,\'&#8221; Fogel said. &#8220;That chapter&#8217;s title used to be just &#8216;Money,&#8217; so that gives you some idea of what the new material is.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also found the third chapter on technical infrastructure to be more time consuming than the others due to all of the changes in the past decade. It took roughly four and a half months to revise it to include modern development tools.</p>\n<p>One of the central focuses of the book is the value of collaboration and the direct benefits it provides to an open source software project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Competence at cooperation itself is one of the most highly valued skills in free software,&#8221; Fogel wrote in the preface. &#8220;Good free software is a worthy goal in itself&#8230; But beyond that I also hope to convey something of the sheer pleasure to be had from working with a motivated team of open source developers, and from interacting with users in the wonderfully direct way that open source encourages. Participating in a successful free software project is a deep pleasure, and ultimately that&#8217;s what keeps the whole system going.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 23:13:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"Post Status: New Year’s resolutions for WordPress developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=32188\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://poststatus.com/new-years-resolutions-wordpress-developers/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15739:\"<p><em><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong></em> This is a guest post by <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/profiles/jack-lenox/\">Jack Lenox</a>.

Getting started with the VIP team was an eye-opening and occasionally terrifying learning experience, occasionally resulting in me thinking: &#8220;please excuse me for a moment while I go and fix some horrible vulnerability in all of my WordPress sites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Recently, I have cautiously found myself feeling slightly more comfortable with my position on the team. For some time, I have been wanting to document the most interesting and impactful things that I have learned in the past year.</p>\n<p>As some readers may know, a significant part of a developer&#8217;s job on the VIP team is reviewing code. Thus, with us being at the start a new year, I have hereby compiled some of the most interesting best practices I have discovered as a list of New Year&#8217;s Resolutions:</p>\n<h3>1. Use strict comparison operators</h3>\n<p>One of the many quirks of PHP is that it enjoys juggling. In particular, it enjoys <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php\">juggling types</a>. This means that without explicit instruction, PHP doesn&#8217;t see a difference between a string of &#8220;string&#8221;, an integer of 0, and a boolean value of <code>true</code>.</p>\n<p>So for example this:</p>\n<pre><code>$var = 0;\nif ( $var == \'safe_string\' ) {\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Will return true. I know, what?! The easy solution here is to simply use strict comparison operators.</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s <code>===</code> instead of <code>==</code>, and <code>!==</code> instead of <code>!=</code>. This pops up in a few other places too. By default the <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.in-array.php\"><code>in_array()</code></a> function has its strict parameter set to false.</p>\n<p>So:</p>\n<pre><code>in_array( 0, [\'safe_value\', \'another string\'] );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Will return true. To fix this, simply pass a third parameter of <code>true</code>.</p>\n<p>While we&#8217;re here, there&#8217;s one other form of comparison we should be aware of, and that&#8217;s <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash-equals.php\"><code>hash_equals()</code></a>. This provides a string comparison that prevents timing attacks.</p>\n<p>While a relatively uncommon form of attack on the web, it&#8217;s worth being aware of a timing attack. What is it? Well, when PHP compares two strings, it compares them one character at a time.</p>\n<p>So in the case of something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>$submitted_password = $_POST[\'password\']; // For argument\'s sake, let\'s say it\'s \"pa45word\"\n$password = \"pa55word\";\n\nif ( $submitted password === $password ) {\n    go_forth();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>PHP&#8217;s thought process in human terms is: Is the first character of each string p? Yes it is. Is the second character of each string a? Yes it is. And so on.</p>\n<p>It will do this until it realizes that the third characters differ and at that point it will bail. Thus, with sophisticated timing software, a password can gradually be worked out by calculating how long the process is taking. If the process takes slightly longer with one character than it does with every other character, an attacker will know that they have worked out the first character.</p>\n<p>Automated processes can keep doing this until the entire password is worked out. <code>hash_equals()</code> will compare two values, but will not bail early if it detects a difference.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, if you&#8217;re comparing sensitive values, use <code>hash_equals()</code>!</p>\n<h3>2. Use Yoda condition checks, you must</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/#yoda-conditions\">WordPress PHP Coding Standards</a> suggest that you should: &#8220;always put the variable on the right side and put constants, literals or function calls on the left side.&#8221; Initially, this might just sound like a bit of pedantry, but it actually has a very practical application.</p>\n<p>Consider how catastrophic the following typo could be:</p>\n<pre><code>if ( $session_authorized = true ) {\n    unleash_the_secrets();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Oh dear, instead of checking that <code>$session_authorized</code> is true, I am instead assigning the value of true to that variable.</p>\n<p>Now the secrets are being unleashed to whoever wants them. This could easily be missed when checking the code for bugs, even by a reviewer.</p>\n<p>Now imagine if the first line was expressed as:</p>\n<pre><code>if ( true = $session_authorized ) {\n</code></pre>\n<p>Well, it doesn&#8217;t. We can&#8217;t assign a variable to the static boolean value of <code>true</code>.</p>\n<p>Hopefully it won&#8217;t take us too long to work out why our code is still broken, but the secrets remain safe. So we&#8217;re good! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f600.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<h3>3. ABE. A Always, B Be, E Escaping. Always Be Escaping. ALWAYS Be Escaping.</h3>\n<p>Not having a firm grasp of the concepts of validation, sanitization and escaping can make you a very dangerous developer indeed.</p>\n<p>To the extent that libraries like React escape all output by default and to bypass this functionality, you have to use the attribute: <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code></p>\n<p>Validation is checking that what your code is being passed is even vaguely what it&#8217;s expecting. So for instance, if we&#8217;re expecting an integer, we can use something like: <code>$zipcode = intval( $_POST[\'my-zipcode\'] )</code></p>\n<p>The <code>intval()</code> function returns its input as an integer and defaults to zero if the input was a non-numeric value. So while this won&#8217;t prevent our code from being passed zipcodes that aren&#8217;t valid, it does protect our code from being passed anything that isn&#8217;t a number.</p>\n<p>Naturally, we could go a step further to see if the zipcode actually appears to be valid. For example, 1111111111111 is not a valid zip code, but <code>intval()</code> doesn&#8217;t know that.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, beyond integers, WordPress has <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Data_Validation#Input_Validation\">a bunch of handy helper functions for almost every data type</a> including my favourite: <code>is_email().</code></p>\n<p>Sanitization is cleaning input to make sure that it&#8217;s safe in the context where we want to use it. This prevents one of the most common forms of security vulnerability, an <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_injection\">SQL injection attack</a>.</p>\n<p>We also sanitize to fix practical things, like checking for invalid UTF-8 characters. WordPress has a class of <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Data_Validation#Input_Validation\"><code>sanitize_*()</code> helper functions</a>; here&#8217;s an example of how one looks in the wild:</p>\n<pre><code>$title = sanitize_text_field( $_POST[\'title\'] );\nupdate_post_meta( $post-&gt;ID, \'title\', $title );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Therefore no matter what garbage we might have been passed in <code>$_POST[\'title\']</code>, it won&#8217;t cause any real problems.</p>\n<p>Escaping is similar to sanitization, but instead it is cleaning what we&#8217;re sending out, rather than what we&#8217;re taking in. A major reason for doing this is to prevent another of the most common forms of security vulnerability, a <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS\">Cross-site Scripting (or XSS) attack</a>.</p>\n<p>We want to clean our output to ensure we aren&#8217;t accidentally echoing out something very dangerous that we didn&#8217;t realize we were inadvertently storing in our database (or perhaps fetched from an API).</p>\n<p>WordPress has <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Data_Validation#Output_Sanitization\">a bunch of very useful helper functions here</a>. Some common examples of these in the wild are:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;?php echo esc_html( $title ); ?&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;?php echo esc_url( $great_user_picture_url ); ?&gt;\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>&lt;ul class=\"&lt;?php echo esc_attr( $stored_class ); ?&gt;\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is also <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_kses/\"><code>wp_kses()</code></a> which can be used on everything that is expected to contain HTML, and will filter out elements that are not explicitly allowed.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, the <code>the_*()</code> and <code>get_the_*()</code> theme functions are already escaped. However, the <code>get_bloginfo()</code> function, for example, is not escaped.</p>\n<p>For further information here, I highly recommend checking out the VIP team&#8217;s documentation on <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip/best-practices/security/validating-sanitizing-escaping/\">Validating, Sanitizing, and Escaping</a>.</p>\n<h3>4. Stop trusting everything</h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t trust user input. Don&#8217;t trust what&#8217;s in your database. Don&#8217;t trust any variables.</p>\n<p>Treat every variable with contempt.</p>\n<p>This way, even if, for example, someone sneaks some dodgy XSS code into your database, it&#8217;ll still get escaped on output and your site will be better protected.</p>\n<h3>5. Avoid inserting HTML directly into the document (when using JavaScript)</h3>\n<p>Doing something like this is dangerous because the data that we&#8217;re using could include many more DOM elements that dramatically alter the anticipated behavior of this code, and make it vulnerable to XSS attacks:</p>\n<pre><code>jQuery.ajax({\n    url: \'http://any-site.com/endpoint.json\'\n}).done( function( data ) {\n    var link = \'&lt;a href=\"\' + data.url + \'\"&gt;\' + data.title + \'&lt;/a&gt;\';\n\njQuery( \'#my-div\' ).html( link );\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Instead, we should programmatically create DOM nodes and append them to the DOM. So the above instead becomes this:</p>\n<pre><code>jQuery.ajax({\n    url: \'http://any-site.com/endpoint.json\'\n}).done( function( data ) {\n    var a = jQuery( \'&lt;a /&gt;\' );\n    a.attr( \'href\', data.url );\n    a.text( data.title );\n\njQuery( \'#my-div\' ).append( a );\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is how a library like React does things behind the scenes. You can read more about this in <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/preventing-xss-in-javascript/\">a wonderful post about preventing XSS attacks in JavaScript</a> by my colleague, Nick Daugherty.</p>\n<h3>6. Review code</h3>\n<p>Have you ever reviewed a plugin before using it? I know, who&#8217;s got time for that right? I&#8217;ll tell you who: you.</p>\n<p>I have come to realize that reviewing code is possibly one of the best exercises for improving as a developer. Even if you&#8217;re quite new to programming or development, and you still feel pretty green, you really should give it a go.</p>\n<p>A great way to start is to review the next plugin you decide to use on your website. Before activating it, pop it open in your text editor of choice, and just spend some time scanning through it to understand what it does.</p>\n<p>A method I like to use here is to interpret each line of the code in simple English. You can even say it loud if you like – assuming you&#8217;re not sitting in a café or co-working space where people might become worried about you.</p>\n<p>You might be surprised at how often you find bugs and quirks in the code, or that the code isn&#8217;t conforming to the best practices outlined above. And if you discover issues, why not create a patch? Or if the plugin is on GitHub, create a pull request.</p>\n<p>You can also review your own code. A great method for doing this is to never deploy code straight into production. Instead, leave it on the day you finish it, and review it line by line in the morning. This method is easiest to adopt if you&#8217;re using something like GitHub where you can create a pull request with the changes, then review the pull request yourself the next day before merging it.</p>\n<p>In this vein, I highly recommend watching my colleague, Ryan Markel&#8217;s, <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/10/ryan-markel-code-review-keeping-things-secure-clean-and-performant/\">fantastic talk on this topic from WordCamp US 2016</a>.</p>\n<h3>7. Upgrade your tools (or at least use PHP_CodeSniffer)</h3>\n<p>There are lots of tools that help make web development easier, but if you&#8217;re doing a lot of WordPress development, the most valuable is probably <a href=\"https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer\">PHP<em>CodeSniffer</em></a>. It reads your code and automatically reviews it for bugs and coding standards inconsistencies while you type.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s kind of like a spell checker, but for code. No matter how good your English is, you still use spell check right? So why wouldn&#8217;t you spell check your code?</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a bonus for you: the WordPress VIP Coding Standards are available by default with the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards\">WordPress Coding Standards for PHPCodeSniffer</a>. So with that, it&#8217;ll check if you&#8217;re following most of the above resolutions.</p>\n<p>As you might imagine, using PHP_CodeSniffer also really helps highlight potential problems when you&#8217;re reviewing plugins and other people&#8217;s code.</p>\n<h3>8. Be curious</h3>\n<p>Far too often, I&#8217;m guilty of searching to try to find out what a particular WordPress function does, or scanning Stack Overflow to see if someone&#8217;s having the same problem as me.</p>\n<p>I have historically had a bad habit of seeing much of what WordPress does as magic, and avoiding getting too deep in the inner workings. But actually, it can be very beneficial to find out answers for yourself, instead of trying to find others who have already done the work.</p>\n<p>In essence, WordPress is quite simple. The code largely consists of functions taking arguments, and doing things with those arguments, and passing the results onto other functions taking arguments, and so on.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t take much to start unpicking something, and working out exactly what&#8217;s happening behind the scenes. So next time you&#8217;re struggling with a function, try going straight to looking at what the function actually does.</p>\n<p>Personally I find the <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress\">WordPress GitHub repo</a> that mirrors the core SVN repo to be a very useful way of doing this.</p>\n<p>The WordPress strapline is that &#8220;code is poetry&#8221;, and for its flaws I find that on the most part, the WordPress codebase is very readable, if nothing else! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll conclude by taking this opportunity to wish you a very happy and prosperous new year!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Note</em>:</strong> Some of the above has been gleefully plagiarized from <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip/code-review-what-we-look-for/\">WordPress.com VIP&#8217;s Code Review documentation</a>. It&#8217;s an Aladdin&#8217;s cave of useful advice, and I highly recommend working your way through it as and when you can.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 21:26:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Jack Lenox\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"WPTavern: Tom McFarlin to Launch Marketplace for Blogging Plugins, Finds New Maintainer for WordPress.org Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=64899\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:123:\"https://wptavern.com/tom-mcfarlin-to-launch-marketplace-for-blogging-plugins-finds-new-maintainer-for-wordpress-org-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5189:\"<p>Daily blogger and plugin author Tom McFarlin has found a new maintainer for five of his WordPress.org plugins. Within two days of <a href=\"https://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-plugin-adoption/\" target=\"_blank\">putting the plugins up for adoption</a>, McFarlin <a href=\"https://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-plugins-adopted/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philip_arthur\" target=\"_blank\">Philip Arthur Moore</a> will be taking over Category Sticky Post, Comment Tweets, Single Post Message, Tag Sticky Post, and Tipsy Social Icons. Moore, who is currently working as CTO at <a href=\"https://professionalthemes.nyc/\" target=\"_blank\">Professional Themes</a>, has inherited roughly 10,000 users overnight in the transfer of maintainership.</p>\n<p>WordPress.org plugin adoption stories are few and far between. The most common scenario for an orphaned plugin is to languish in the directory until it disappears from search results (with the exception of exact matches) after two years of no updates. In McFarlin&#8217;s case, he was looking to tie up some loose ends before shifting Pressware&#8217;s focus to launching Blogging Plugins, a marketplace for extensions that streamline WordPress for regular bloggers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Last year, I had a few false starts when trying to launch what was originally called Pressware Plugins,&#8221; McFarlin said. &#8220;Fast-forward a few months and we’re going to focus on something called Blogging Plugins. We already have two free plugins available, though there’s an entire set of plugins, marketplace, and more coming.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Moore&#8217;s adoption of the plugins, which includes the first plugin McFarlin ever wrote, allows Pressware to move forward with its <a href=\"https://tommcfarlin.com/2017-plans/\" target=\"_blank\">2017 objectives</a>. McFarlin said he selected Moore based on the quality of his open source projects and reputation in the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For those of you who aren’t familiar with Philip’s side projects, you may be familiar with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/subtitles/\" target=\"_blank\">Subtitles</a>,&#8221; McFarlin said. &#8220;It’s a plugin that falls right in line with my personal ethos of how things should work with WordPress: You activate it, it’s ready to go, and it feels native within the application.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Why would I adopt <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tommcfarlin\">@tommcfarlin</a>\'s work? Because I owe him. He\'s ethical, an amazing man, and a stellar coder: <a href=\"https://t.co/WM66Xu1vm1\">https://t.co/WM66Xu1vm1</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Philip Arthur Moore (@philip_arthur) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philip_arthur/status/817399604698173440\">January 6, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/adopt-me\" target=\"_blank\">adopt-me</a> tag is used on WordPress.org to indicate plugins where the author is looking for a new maintainer. With just two pages of listings, it&#8217;s not yet widely used. Most developers find it easier to fork an open source plugin and WordPress.org has recently made it easier than ever for authors to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/12/22/want-to-close-your-plugins-email/\" target=\"_blank\">close a plugin</a> by simply emailing the plugin team.</p>\n<p>However, not all orphaned plugins are ready for end of life measures. Circumstances change in plugin authors&#8217; lives, but the strength of the user base is one of the primary indicators of a project that could thrive in new hands. The built-in user base is also one of the main advantages of adopting a plugin as opposed to forking it.</p>\n<p>Developer and ZDNet columnist David Gewirtz discovered the full weight of adopting a plugin&#8217;s users when he <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-year-later-what-happens-when-you-adopt-an-open-source-project/\" target=\"_blank\">took on 10 plugins</a> from the adopt-me section of the directory. Gewirtz, who inherited approximately 50,000 users, said the experience helped him reconnect with real users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The value I&#8217;ve gained as a columnist, advisor, and educator that has come from interacting with users from so many nations with so many different skill sets and missions has been off the charts,&#8221; Gewirtz said. &#8220;I thought I&#8217;d keep my programming chops up, and I&#8217;ve certainly done that. But I never expected I&#8217;d gain a much broader perspective that I&#8217;d be able to apply to all of the areas of my professional life and meet so many cool people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Adoption is arguably the healthiest outcome for any orphaned project &#8211; not just for the sake of reducing plugin abandonment but also for continuing support for users. Many of them blindly depend on plugins with no understanding of how they work.</p>\n<p>Once a plugin is downloaded and installed on users&#8217; sites, it gains a life of its own. Adoption strengthens a project&#8217;s history by proving it can weather storms that might otherwise cause the plugin to become obsolete and wipe out the user base.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 07:59:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Matt: Thirty-Three\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47034\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://ma.tt/2017/01/thirty-three/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4279:\"<p>I&#8217;m taking it easy this week, nothing too crazy &#8212; just sharing good meals and wine with friends. Which is probably a good example of my goals for the year: putting family and loved ones first, slowing down (<a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/10/run-better/\">to go further</a>), and deliciousness. (<a href=\"https://www.singlethreadfarms.com/\">Single Thread Farms</a> blew me away.)</p>\n<p>2016 was a year of incredible contrasts: it was the saddest and most challenged I&#8217;ve ever been with the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/04/in-memoriam-chuck-mullenweg/\">passing of my father</a>, and while that overshadowed everything there were also bright moments of coming closer to family, deepening friendships, and growing professionally with incredible progress from both WordPress and Automattic. That momentum on the professional side is carrying through and right now I&#8217;m the most optimistic I can recall, and thrilled to wake up and get to work every day with the people I do.</p>\n<p>I talked about trying to spend longer stretches of time in fewer places, and that definitely happened. I flew 162k fewer miles than <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/01/thirty-two/\">the year before</a>, and visited 35 fewer cities. My blogging decreased a lot too &#8212; from 252 posts in 2015 to 76 posts in 2016, but the posts I did write were at least 50% longer. I made it to 9 more of the Top 50 restaurants and stand currently at 50% of <a href=\"http://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners\">the list</a>. I finished <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/saxmatt/books-in-2016/\">22 books</a>, including a lot more fiction including my first few graphic novels like Ex Machina, Y: The Last Man, and Watchmen. I watched 35 movies, 9 of which were from the Marvel universe on a single flight from Cape Town to Dubai.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/01/thirty-two/\">Last year</a> I said, &#8220;it’s exciting to make the most of the opportunity that the volatility, love, loss, glory, failure, inspirations, and setbacks that 2016 will bring.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know how right I would be, and wish I hadn&#8217;t been.</p>\n<p>This year doesn&#8217;t start with new plans, but rather three intentions continued from a few months ago. I <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/01/rebirth-and-yellow-arrows/\">revealed one yesterday</a>, and promised I would expand today on the others, so here they are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Symmetry</strong> &#8212; Balance in all things, including my body which is stronger on my right side and much tighter on my left side. We also need symmetry in WordPress between the .org and .com products which differ too much.</li>\n<li><strong>Stillness</strong> &#8212; In echoes <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-Stillness-Adventures-Going-Nowhere-ebook/dp/B00JSRQSJS\">of Pico Iyer</a>, so much of my life in my 20s was about movement, and &#8220;going places to be moved.&#8221; In my 30s I&#8217;m looking inward. As Saint Augustine said in Book X, chapter 8 of <em>Confessions</em>: &#8220;Men go forth to wonder at the heights of mountains, the huge waves of the sea, the broad flow of the rivers, the vast compass of the ocean, the courses of the stars, and they pass by themselves without wondering.&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Yellow Arrows</strong> &#8212; The idea that there are clear indications of where to go next at every fork in the road, and if not you should paint them. I wrote more <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/01/rebirth-and-yellow-arrows/\">on this  yesterday</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Previously: <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2003/01/bday/\">19</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2004/01/so-im-20/\">20</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2005/01/hot-barely-legal-matt/\">21</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2006/01/matt-22/\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2007/01/twenty-three/\">23</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2008/01/twenty-four/\">24</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2009/01/twenty-five/\">25</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2010/01/twenty-six/\">26</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2011/01/twenty-seven/\">27</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2012/01/twenty-eight/\">28</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2013/01/twenty-nine/\">29</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/01/matt-3-0/\">30</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2015/01/thirty-one/\">31</a>, and <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/01/thirty-two/\">32</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 07:59:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.7.1 Fixes Eight Security Issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=65100\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-1-fixes-eight-security-issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2146:\"<p>WordPress 4.7.1 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/01/wordpress-4-7-1-security-and-maintenance-release/\">is available</a> for download and fixes eight security issues that affect WordPress 4.7 and below.

We’re going to start testing this using Instant Articles, so that readers can start to see <a href=\"https://media.fb.com/2017/01/11/multiple-instant-articles/\" target=\"_blank\">multiple stories</a> at a time from their favorite news organizations.&#8221; Facebook is currently testing this feature with BILD, BuzzFeed, El Pais, Fox News, Hindustan Times, The Sun, The Washington Post, and other publishers.</p>\n<p>In April 2016, Automattic partnered with Facebook and VIP-Featured-Partner agency Dekode to develop <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fb-instant-articles/\" target=\"_blank\">Instant Articles for WP</a>, a plugin that outputs a compliant feed of posts wrapped in the required markup for Facebook. The plugin passed 10K active installs at the end of 2016, but its star rating continues to plummet due to numerous errors with updates and a lack of support. Only 1 of 42 support threads has been marked resolved in the last two months. Publishers who depend on the plugin may need to have a developer on staff to handle issues with the plugin or select another solution.</p>\n<p>Facebook is also planning to collaborate with publishers on subscription business models for their content. Participation in this feature will require the publisher to make its content available through Instant Articles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many of our partners have placed a renewed emphasis on growing their subscription funnel, and we’ve already begun exploring ways we can support these efforts,&#8221; Simo said. &#8220;This month our engineering team in collaboration with the engineering team of the German news organization BILD will launch a test to explore offering free trials to engaged readers, right from within Instant Articles.&#8221; Simo also said they are working on other monetization options for publishing partners, including advertising breaks in regular videos.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 21:49:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"HeroPress: Blogging, Solopreneurship, &amp; Terrorism\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1563\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://heropress.com/essays/blogging-solopreneurship-terrorism/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13067:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/011117-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: We will survive this, and this too will pass. You have my word.\" /><p>This story involves me as a blogger, the Prime Minister, me again as a web developer, an Islamic cult attempting a coup d&#8217;état, and me again as a solopreneur. Oh, and WordPress. And ISIS.</p>\n<h2>WordPress: My First Encounter</h2>\n<p>In the beginning of 2006, everyone in Turkey was talking about blogs. It was the hot new thing on the web. Forums were &#8220;out&#8221; and blogs were &#8220;in&#8221;. Anyways, I was getting ready for the ÖSS and studying to get into a university but I was psyched enough to register a blog on WordPress.com, on January 2006. (I moved the blog into a free hosting space the next month, and opened up <a href=\"http://beyn.org\">beyn.org</a> in July 2006.) I was in Kocaeli, the city right next to İstanbul.</p>\n<p>After the registration, I realized that I had nothing to write about. So I wrote about the day I had. The next day, I did the same thing. And the next day. And the next seven and a half years. Of course, I skipped four or five days. But that kind of dedication earned me a reputation and an award for &#8220;Best Personal Blogger of 2008&#8221;.</p>\n<p>But I didn&#8217;t just write about my days. After getting accepted into Ankara University in September 2006, I began to read and think about politics, as nearly all young Turks do in university. Eventually, I started writing about politics as well. Because you know what they say: If you want to learn something, write about it.</p>\n<p>Oh, I learned it pretty well, and I learned it the (somewhat) hard way.</p>\n<h2>Facing Jail Time with a Blog Post</h2>\n<p>2010 was probably my darkest year in my entire life. (2016 is the next candidate.) I was 22 years old, blogging daily, learning about web design and WordPress (more on that later), and keeping up with what&#8217;s going on with the country. Things were crazy back then: A very big prosecution was going on called the Ergenekon Case about military people allegedly planning a coup (Hint: This is not the coup I mentioned in the intro! These guys were all acquitted later.) and a big campaign for a constitutional referandum was more than enough to keep the whole country busy.</p>\n<p>In December 2010, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Prime Minister of the time (and the President since 2014) sued me for one of my blog posts. It was about one of the slogans he used in his referandum rallies (&#8220;The terrorists and the opposition parties are soul mates!&#8221;) and me using the same sentence against him. Like, <em>the exact same sentence</em>. He didn&#8217;t like the way that the slogan was used against him, so he reported me and the state brought charges against me. I was 22 and I was being sued by the most powerful man in the country, because I used his words against him.</p>\n<p>When the Prime Minister sues you, you go to jail. There were little to no instances of winning a case against the government, especially when they were the one suing you. Thankfully, I was one of the few instances: I won the case in my third trial, February 14, 2012. (&#8220;Lovely&#8221; day, isn&#8217;t it?)</p>\n<p>There were one downside though: With the fear of the government suing me, I stopped writing about politics in 2011 and 2012, and even a few months after I won. And to this day, even though that fear is long gone, and even though I&#8217;m writing about politics again on Beyn, I still can&#8217;t write regularly like I did back then.</p>\n<p>Anyways. Moving on with the &#8220;web development&#8221; phase of my life.</p>\n<h2>Learning to Develop WordPress, and Teaching It at the Same Time</h2>\n<p>When I started Beyn, I immediately loved WordPress. I had some experience on HTML and CSS on Dreamweaver (never was a FrontPage guy), and I happily retired DW because I won&#8217;t be able to work on it while I was learning WordPress.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember trying to learn something with such passion. I loved the idea of plugins and themes extending the core. Beyn became my playground for new tricks, my laboratory for new experiments about WordPress. I installed plugins, edited themes, learned what&#8217;s right and what&#8217;s wrong with what I did&#8230; I probably crashed the website more than a hundred times!</p>\n<p>By 2012, I&#8217;d already started making websites for other people and getting paid. I had developed a few plugins, made a couple of themes from scratch. While still learning what awesome things I&#8217;m able to do with WordPress, I applied for a small writing gig at Wptuts+, which was later renamed <a href=\"https://tutsplus.com/authors/baris-unver\">Tuts+ Code</a>. Because you know what they say: If you want to learn something, write about it.</p>\n<p>That &#8220;small writing gig&#8221; was in fact my biggest source of education. I wasn&#8217;t a WordPress expert, but that gig was the ultimate reason to learn more and more about WordPress. I remember constantly feeling that &#8220;I&#8217;ve finished telling about everything I know about WordPress, so now I have to learn more!&#8221; and doing research on things to write about.</p>\n<p>I was aware that I don&#8217;t have any chance to write a sloppy tutorial, so I nagged my editors (first Japh Thomson, then Tom McFarlin) about my writing style, my choice of topics and of course, my English. They said my English was very good, and my topics are relevant and suitable for publishing on Tuts+. In almost exactly four years (from April 2012 to March 2016), I wrote 134 posts and I&#8217;m very proud of (almost) all my work there.</p>\n<p>While it was sad to leave Tuts+, I had a project in my mind that I put off so long: <a href=\"https://optimocha.com/\">Optimocha</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Speed Optimization with Terrorists, Bombs and Death</h2>\n<p>That title came out grimmer than I expected. Heh. <em>Anyways.</em></p>\n<p>2015 was the year when I first thought about a speed optimization service for WordPress-based websites. Then I thought that I would better use my energy on the upcoming general elections in June. I worked for an NGO called &#8220;Vote and Beyond&#8221; to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_and_Beyond\">ensure transparency in observering of ballot count in the elections</a>.</p>\n<p>2015 was also the year with a whole lot of terrorist attacks. PKK, a terrorist organization <em>pretending</em> to defend Kurds&#8217; rights (while giving a bad name for all Kurds countrywide) and ISIS (you know them) were the most active terrorist organizations in 2015. They killed more than 250 people and injured more than 1000 in a series of shootings and bombings throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Worst year ever, right? <em>Not even close.</em> Let me quickly summarize the hell we&#8217;ve been through:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ISIS killed 116 people in 5 different attacks.</li>\n<li>PKK killed 176 people in 15 different attacks.</li>\n<li>TAK, PKK&#8217;s even uglier cousin, killed 43 people in 4 different attacks.</li>\n<li>FETO killed 248 people across the country in their coup d&#8217;état attempt on July 15.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>583 people killed in terrorist attacks in 2016. <em>So, just a few more than all those lovely celebrities.</em></p>\n<p>What&#8217;s that FETO sticking out among the others, attempting a coup? That&#8217;s <strong>FE</strong>thullahist <strong>T</strong>errorist <strong>O</strong>rganization: The organization of Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic cult leader comfortably residing in Pennsylvania, plotting to take over the government for (I kid you not) over 40 years. Even I had made peace with the President because of the much needed &#8220;purges&#8221; to scrape his crypto-disciples in the government organizations. FETO is one of the enemies that can let you make peace with the ones against your values.</p>\n<p>(By the way: While celebrating that we got rid off that horror show of 2016, ISIS killed 39 more people with an AK-47 in a New Year party on January 1, in the middle of the night.)</p>\n<p>Still waiting for the part where I founded Optimocha, right? Sorry it took a bit long.</p>\n<p>April 2016 was the month I registered my company by paying for the usual fees to register a sole proprietorship, accountant fees, rent for an office (because by law, you can&#8217;t register a company without an office), some paperwork. All my funds vanished, leaving me with nothing to spend on marketing.</p>\n<p>PayPal halted operations in Turkey on June, because of conflicts with the government. 2CheckOut followed. I was going to use 2CO, so I was left with no payment gateway provider. Along with the terrorist attacks, I decided to spend Ramadan (the holy month for Muslims, passed on June 2016) sleeping, lying and moping around with depression.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of July, I was ready to work again, amped up for success! Except the coup attempt happened. Bombs and sonic booms in my city. Back to depression.</p>\n<p>By October, I was almost ready to go live with <a href=\"https://optimocha.com/\">the website</a>. I didn&#8217;t. I forced myself to finish it in November, before Black Friday. <em>I did!</em> People responded to my emails, said they&#8217;ll publish my deal on their blogs. People who saw the deal also responded and purchased my services. Yay.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Blogging is hard. Blogging with the most powerful man in your country trying to lock you up is the hardest.</p>\n<p>Solopreneurship is hard. Solopreneurship with several, highly active terrorist organizations killing people next to you is the hardest.</p>\n<p>Yet, <em>and I&#8217;m sure this is going to sound cheesy</em>, I have hope. This is the price we have to pay in order to get rid of the scum in the world. Turkey isn&#8217;t the worst country in the world suffering from terror&#8211;we&#8217;re just a country stuck between Europe, Russia, the Middle East and Africa. (Talk about a rock and a hard place&#8230;) We will survive this, and this too will pass.</p>\n<p>Turkey may be viewed as &#8220;yet another Middle Eastern country&#8221;, but it was founded almost a hundred years ago with the heritage of the Ottoman Empire, but also with a Western, secular mindset. <em>Even today</em>, you can&#8217;t find a sensible person talking trash about Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who declined the Ottoman monarchy to set the foundation of a democratic republic in a time of dictatorships across Europe and Asia. Emphasis on the words &#8220;even today&#8221;, because the principles of his <em>vision</em> of the Republic of Turkey is in danger, a very large portion of the country has the confidence and equipment to defend those principles.</p>\n<p>Again: We will survive this, and this too will pass.

I had the good fortune to read it a few months ago and the story of the Camino de Santiago touched and inspired me.</p>\n<p>Because of the impact of the book, I ended up adopting a few New Year&#8217;s intentions long before January 1st &#8212; things to ruminate on and keep in mind as the year wound down. The outlook of the world seemed uncertain, and I&#8217;m learning to navigate the world without my father.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<h3>Yellow Arrows</h3>\n<p>The Camino de Santiago is a pilgrimage path in Spain that people have walked since the 9th century AD. The 500 mile path winds through mountains, fields, and sometimes cities, and many pilgrims take a month or more on it. In some ways it is similar to <a href=\"http://walkkumano.com/\">the Kumano Kodo walk I did with Dan and Craig last year</a>.</p>\n<p>There are places where the path isn&#8217;t exactly clear, either because the trail isn&#8217;t strong, there&#8217;s been growth, or you might be in a crowded urban area like a city. Over the years pilgrims and people who live on the trail have marked it with yellow arrows pointing the way. If someone gets lost or confused, it&#8217;s an opportunity for an additional sign to bring them back on track.</p>\n<p>When you know the path, is it clear where someone else walking it should go next? It&#8217;s an interesting concept that applies across life. In your relationships, does your friend, loved one, or partner know what to expect, and where you&#8217;re headed together? Even in WordPress I feel like there are too many places where we bring someone to a fork in the road and there is no clear indication which way they should take.</p>\n<p>Give some thought to the yellow arrows in your life, and I&#8217;ll write more about the other two things I&#8217;ve been thinking about tomorrow. Also don&#8217;t forget <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rebirth-Fable-Forgiveness-Following-Heart/dp/0316312282/\">to pick up a copy of Kamal&#8217;s book</a>.

Entering the WordPress.org username of a plugin or theme author or a WordPress core contributor into the field generates a list of statistics that includes:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Profile information</li>\n<li>Number of times their plugins and themes were downloaded</li>\n<li>Most downloaded plugins and themes</li>\n<li>Average number of downloads per week</li>\n<li>Plugin and theme review rating average</li>\n<li>Percentage of five-star ratings</li>\n<li>A selection of five-star reviews</li>\n<li>Number of commits, changes, and comments to WordPress core</li>\n<li>Number of WordPress releases contributed to</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Engelen got the idea to create the site in 2014 after Spotify launched its &#8216;<a href=\"https://news.spotify.com/us/2014/12/03/2014-a-year-in-music/\">Year in Music</a>&#8216; that highlighted trends based on what 50 million users listened too.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’d been active in the WordPress plugin market for about four years at that point, and I figured it would be really cool to get some year-over-year insight into your WordPress plugins,&#8221; Engelen said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having become a partner at Admin Columns (a freemium WordPress plugin) in 2014, I found out that I really liked analyzing statistics of downloads, sales and other data, and that, properly grouped and reported, they could have a pretty big influence on decision-making from a business perspective.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Engelen started the site by experimenting with fetching data from WordPress.org through its API that would show the change in the number of downloads to a user&#8217;s plugins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That is basically what lead to the &#8216;Your most popular plugins&#8217; overview page,&#8221; Engelen said. &#8220;Spending some free hours each week on working on the project, more and more ideas of data to include popped up.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>The site displays a lot of data, but it doesn&#8217;t include everything. Engelen would like to eventually display sections for contributions to WordPress translations, plugins, themes, core, design, etc.</p>\n<h2>The Technical Details</h2>\n<p>The data displayed on Year in WordPress is gathered using the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API\">WordPress.org API</a>, subversion, and web scraping. Engelen would have used the WordPress REST API but it was not available at the time, &#8220;Fetching the reviews and support topics yielded quite a bit of annoyance, as they’re done by scraping,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>He uses a Python framework to fetch relevant data in parallel. The data is stored in an SQL database, which is accessed by a front-end tool. The front-end of the site features a design that was reused from <a href=\"https://www.admincolumns.com/\">AdminColumns.com</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;jQuery, combined with Chart.js and Fullpage.js power the interactive portion of Year in WordPress. I’ve also written some simple sentiment analysis code for filtering out the most popular reviews to show for each plugin/theme developer,&#8221; Engelen said.</p>\n<h2>Fun Facts about Year in WordPress</h2>\n<p>Engelen provided the Tavern with these fun facts related to Year in WordPress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There’s a Year in Review for about 100,000 users on WordPress.org — or all users who have contributed to a plugin or theme, created a review or a support ticket, or contributed to WordPress core.</li>\n<li>The full database takes about 500MB of space.</li>\n<li>There were 364,763,308 plugin/theme downloads in 2015, and 434,865,745 in 2016.

It allows users to edit text strings without editing WordPress core or plugin code. Lee Willis released Say What in 2013, but the plugin had a significant jump in users in 2016, doubling the number of active installs from 5,000 to 10,000 sites.</p>\n<p>Willis, who is the author of <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/leewillis77/#content-plugins\" target=\"_blank\">22 plugins</a> hosted on WordPress.org and many more commercial extensions, created Say What while working as a Drupal developer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of our must-install Drupal modules was called String Overrides, which inspired Say What?&#8221; he said. &#8220;At the agency I was working at we used it regularly on virtually every site build to override plugin, theme, and core strings in a &#8216;non-hacky&#8217; way. Given that, I knew that the problem was there to be solved on WordPress, and that something that worked well would be useful to people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Say What adds a new screen for editing text under Tools > Text changes for configuring string replacements. Users enter the current string, text domain, and replacement text.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/say-what-text-edits.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This plugin is a good option for those who are not comfortable sifting through PHP files and adding a filter to change the text. If you just have a handful of strings to replace, it&#8217;s more convenient than using a translation tool like POEDIT to edit the language files. All of the text changes are listed together in the Say What admin panel, so they can be easily changed at any time without editing any files.</p>\n<p>Willis said users don&#8217;t often experience conflicts with themes and plugins, as there is so little frontend functionality included in the plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main areas of support tend to be around locating particular strings, or issues where broken custom code is breaking the filters that Say What uses,&#8221; Willis said. After speaking with friends at a WordCamp in March 2015, he decided to create a commercial version to address this issue and a number of other feature requests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The free version was out for about two years before I launched the <a href=\"https://plugins.leewillis.co.uk/downloads/say-what-pro/\" target=\"_blank\">Pro version</a>,&#8221; Willis said. &#8220;The only issue people tended to have with the free version was around finding the information they needed for the &#8216;original string,&#8217; so I decided to build out the String Discovery feature as the first feature of the Pro version. This lets users search for the string using autocomplete functionality, making it much easier to set up replacements without delving through theme or plugin code.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Say What increased in popularity in 2016 and has maintained a 4.6-star rating on WordPress.org. It is becoming more frequently recommended by support teams of other plugins when customers ask about how to change text strings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great to know that it&#8217;s being used to help people build more future-proof sites without resorting to hacking plugin or core code just to change strings,&#8221; Willis said. &#8220;Even for people familiar with plugin and theme code, the String Discovery feature makes it a lot easier and quicker to set up replacements. It&#8217;s had a few new features over the last year, including support for multi-line, and single/plural style replacements.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Willis said his Pro version proved to be fairly popular during 2016 and became one of his highest selling plugins. He recently added support for multilingual sites, the most often requested feature, allowing users to set up different replacements for different languages.</p>\n<p>Willis does not have an extensive roadmap for the plugin, as he prefers to keep it uncomplicated and free of clutter. &#8220;I&#8217;m a big believer in plugins that do one thing, and do it well,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Say What is another successful instance of a developer solving one of his own problems and striking upon a successful commercial product. Willis said he didn&#8217;t fully anticipate how popular the plugin would become.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As with most of my plugins it was also built to solve a problem that I personally was having at the time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That said, I&#8217;m always (pleasantly) surprised when something does get popular.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After testing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/say-what/\" target=\"_blank\">Say What</a> I found that Willis&#8217; implementation is the simplest way for non-technical users to make a few simple string changes without the risk of breaking their websites. He is also very responsive on the support forums. The success of the Pro version is a good indication that Willis will be able to continue support and maintenance on the free plugin for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 21:26:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: How Laravel Forge Can Help You Run WordPress in the Cloud\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=64940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/how-laravel-forge-can-help-you-run-wordpress-in-the-cloud\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7837:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/petersuhm.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/petersuhm.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1\" alt=\"petersuhm\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-43613\" /></a>This opinion piece was contributed by guest author <a href=\"https://twitter.com/petersuhm\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Suhm</a>.

Recently, it has been made available to WordPress developers too, with the introduction of 1-click installs of WordPress on Digital Ocean, Linode and AWS cloud servers. In this post, I&#8217;ll give you a brief introduction to Laravel Forge and show you how you can use it to manage all of your WordPress installations in the cloud.</p>\n<h3>Laravel Forge is good news for WordPress developers</h3>\n<p>Because so many WordPress developers are used to managed hosting, the thought of running their own servers seem quite intimidating. That&#8217;s a shame with so many great cloud server companies offering virtual servers for very low costs. Unless your traffic is very heavy, a small ($5 to $10 per month) server can run quite a few WordPress websites. Laravel Forge takes care of provisioning your servers and can even setup your database and install WordPress for you. This makes cloud hosting much more available to WordPress developers at a low cost (Laravel Forge is $15 per month for unlimited servers), compared to many of the existing options.</p>\n<p>Here are a few reasons why I think Laravel Forge is great for WordPress hosting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your servers are configured in a secure way by default, with SSH authentication, firewalls, automatic security updates and free SSL certificates from Let&#8217;s Encrypt</li>\n<li>Your servers are going to be really fast with PHP 7</li>\n<li>You can run a lot of WordPress installs on 1 single server *</li>\n<li>You can scale your servers if you need more horse power *</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>* Goes for the cloud in general</em></p>\n<h3>Creating a new server</h3>\n<p>Here is how the &#8220;Create Server&#8221; screen looks in Forge:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/create-server-e1483980109591.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/create-server-e1483980109591.png?resize=1025%2C416&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64946\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you use Digital Ocean, Forge can also create your servers. If you use another provider like Linode or AWS, Forge can only do the provisioning part.</p>\n<p>For Digital Ocean servers, here are the options you can configure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which credentials to use, if you are managing multiple Digital Ocean accounts</li>\n<li>The server name</li>\n<li>The server size</li>\n<li>The server region</li>\n<li>The PHP version</li>\n<li>The default database name</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can then choose to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Configure the server as a load balancer (if you have really heavy traffic and is running WordPress across multiple servers)</li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://mariadb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MariaDB</a> instead of MySQL, which is a drop-in, faster replacement</li>\n<li>Enable weekly backups on Digital Ocean</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When Laravel Forge is done with the provisioning, your server is ready to go.</p>\n<h3>Setting up a database</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/set-up-database-e1483980726266.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/set-up-database-e1483980726266.png?resize=1025%2C484&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64949\" /></a></p>\n<p>Once your server has been created, setting up a database for your WordPress installation is very easy. You can create the user at the same time you&#8217;re creating the database, or you can create the user afterwards.</p>\n<h3>Installing WordPress</h3>\n<p>Before you install WordPress, you need to create a new &#8220;site&#8221; on your server. You can just stick with the defaults:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-site-e1483981223250.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-site-e1483981223250.png?resize=1025%2C453&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64951\" /></a></p>\n<p>For the &#8220;Root Domain&#8221;, you need to add the domain name of the site you are setting up. Remember that you need to add a DNS record for your domain that points to the IP address of your newly created server. If you are just testing, you can always add a record in your computer&#8217;s <code>hosts</code> file with a test domain that points to your server. Something like this:</p>\n<p><code># /etc/hosts</code></p>\n<p><code># Replace xx.xx.xx.xx with your server\'s IP address<br />\nxx.xx.xx.xx wordpress-forge.test</code></p>\n<p>Once you click the &#8220;Add Site&#8221; button, you will see a spinning wheel while Forge is setting up your site&#8217;s nginx configuration.</p>\n<p>When the installation is done, you need to click the &#8220;Manage&#8221; icon next to your site in order to install WordPress. The first screen you will be presented with gives you the option to install an &#8220;App&#8221; on your site. Click the &#8220;WordPress&#8221; button, select your database and user from the previous step and relax while Laravel Forge completes the installation. Fun fact: Laravel Forge is actually using WP-CLI to install WordPress on your server.</p>\n<p>When the installation has completed, visit your site in a browser and you&#8217;ll be met with something familiar:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wp-install-e1483984375432.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wp-install-e1483984375432.png?resize=1025%2C625&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64962\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Setting up a free SSL certificate</h3>\n<p>Finally, you should set up SSL for your WordPress site. It&#8217;s more secure and Google likes it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ssl-setup.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ssl-setup.png?resize=1025%2C288&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64963\" /></a></p>\n<p>Head over on the &#8220;SSL&#8221; tab and click the &#8220;LetsEncrypt (Beta)&#8221; button. Click the &#8220;Obtain Certificate&#8221; button and wait while Forge creates and installs the certificate. Once the certificate is installed, click the &#8220;Activate&#8221; icon and voila! Your site is now all set up and secured with SSL.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s how easy it is to setup WordPress on a cloud server with Laravel Forge. I hope to see a lot of more products and tools like this that can help us building better, faster, and more secure WordPress websites. In fact, Laravel Forge was the original inspiration for my own product <a href=\"https://wppusher.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Pusher</a>. I wanted to create a similar experience, but for WordPress plugins and themes instead.</p>\n<h3>Note on backups and security</h3>\n<p><em>Please note that even though Laravel Forge makes for a great starting point, ultimately you are the one in charge of the security of your servers. You should always try to educate yourself about security and have a backup strategy for your data.</em></p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 09 Jan 2017 18:44:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"Post Status: Contributing to Twenty Seventeen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=31886\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://poststatus.com/contributing-to-twenty-seventeen-theme/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11882:\"<p><em><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong>: This is a guest post by <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/profiles/sami-keijonen/\">Sami Keijonen</a>. Sami is a developer, the owner of the <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/\">Foxland theme and plugin shop</a>, and hails from Finland.</em></p>\n<p>Every year since 2010, WordPress has shipped with a new default theme, breaking the cycle of Kubrick being the primary default theme for years before that.</p>\n<p>In 2010, the default theme was called Twenty Ten. In 2011, the default theme was called Twenty Eleven. You get the idea.</p>\n<p>While every default theme has been unique in its own way, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/\">Twenty Seventeen</a> was particularly compelling in a way we haven’t seen in a default theme since Twenty Fourteen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfourteen/\">Twenty Fourteen</a> was the first theme that really made people think WordPress could be used for more than “just a blog” on a mass scale. It is a magazine theme.</p>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen &#8212; <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-4-7-released/\">released with WordPress 4.7</a> &#8212; is the first theme that really made people think WordPress could be used for more than “just publishing content” on a mass scale. It is a business theme.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Prior to WordPress 4.7, I contributed by helping out in the support forums and building <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/downloads/category/themes/\">accessible themes</a>. But I had never contributed to core before.</p>\n<p>When I saw the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/09/say-hello-to-twenty-seventeen-%25F0%259F%2591%258B%25F0%259F%258F%25BD/\">previews</a>, I knew I wanted to contribute, and began to follow development on GitHub to see if there was anything that I could lend my talents to and eventually make my first core contributions.</p>\n<p>When I saw Morten Rand-Hendriksen <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentyseventeen/issues/60\">open an issue</a> about replacing icon fonts with SVG icons, I knew I had found the perfect “in” to start contributing to core.</p>\n<h3>Contributing SVG icons system to Twenty Seventeen</h3>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>I had already <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/switch-away-icon-fonts-svg/\">switched from icon fonts to SVG icons</a> in my public themes, so this was something I immediately felt confident in contributing to core.</p>\n<p>Development started in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentyseventeen/\">GitHub</a>, where fellow contributors would create issues and submit pull requests.</p>\n<p>Then, everything moved to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk\">WordPress SVN</a>, where new patches were submitted.</p>\n<p>I’ll summarize what I learned in the process.</p>\n<h3>What I learned about contributing</h3>\n<p>I regret not keeping a diary. Not necessarily to keep track of what I contributed, since that’s all documented in the open.</p>\n<p>But rather things like my emotional state. My feelings ranged from despair to overwhelming joy throughout my contribution experience.</p>\n<p>I learned new things about code and collaborating with others in GitHub and SVN. Again, something not necessarily documented in patches and the like.</p>\n<h4>Git workflow</h4>\n<p>I’m not good with Git, and still don’t fully understand how rebasing works. I messed up my commits a couple of times. Not a big deal, but I got different error messages no matter which workflow I tried. I realized that I need to know more about Git, and be more patient.</p>\n<p>Eventually I understood enough to get my contributions through the door, but I’m still confused about <a href=\"https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request\">how to rebase a pull request</a>.</p>\n<h4>Follow the development through to the end, and beyond</h4>\n<p>I started out by replacing only the social link icon fonts to SVG icons. Soon, I realized that a step-by-step process was not going to work because of new related commits coming in all the time that potentially conflicted with my code.</p>\n<p>It was better to replace all icon fonts, not just the social ones, with SVGs, and then work from there. I was also keeping track of style changes in RTL languages and IE8.</p>\n<p>At this point, the work was just getting started.</p>\n<p>Once you start contributing, you shouldn&#8217;t just disappear with no explanation. If you’re running low on time or have other obligations, it’s totally understandable, but be sure to politely inform others you can’t continue anymore, so they can pick up where you left off.</p>\n<p>As the <a href=\"https://geto2.com/\">o2</a> slogan states: &#8220;Communication is oxygen.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>Coding standards and automated tests</h4>\n<p>After several commits and iterations, <a>my first pull request was accepted</a>.</p>\n<p>As you can see in my first commits, I didn’t pass the WordPress coding standards. I needed to be more precise and follow the coding standards to the tee. With enough practice, I’m sure it’s possible to write standards-compliant code “naturally” but I was looking for a way to automate the code checks.</p>\n<p>I tried to get Atom to evaluate my code on the fly, but I just couldn’t get it to work. Like my Git experience, I got different error messages no matter what I tried.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I was able to use <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards\">PHPCS</a> via the command line, and fixed any issues discovered manually. But it would’ve been nice to have those checks automated.</p>\n<h4>Working with batches in SVN</h4>\n<p>Once the development moved to SVN, I began to get a little worried. As I described earlier, not too long ago, I was struggling just to use Git. However, thanks to the following tutorials I quickly got up to speed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-wordpress-locally/from-svn/\">Installing via SVN</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-vcs/%23installing-tortoisesvn\">Installing TortoiseSVN</a> (I use Windows)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/trac/submitting-a-patch/\">Submitting a Patch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/working-with-patches/%23creating-a-patch-with-tortoisesvn\">Creating a Patch with TortoiseSVN</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Turns out, it wasn’t much to be worried about. Although I didn’t quite understand the concept of branches and tags in my local environments, and jumping between them like I know how to do with Git.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I eventually got <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/39072\">my first props</a> with the help of others.</p>\n<h3>Technical overview of the SVG icons system</h3>\n<p>I adapted this contribution from the code and concepts first presented by others.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com/\">WebDevStudios</a> has their own starter theme called <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s\">wd_s</a>. I really like how they set up SVG icons and we fine-tuned them in Twenty Seventeen. Perhaps they will integrate those improvements back into their own project. Again, open source rocks.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/\">Justin Tadlock</a> invented the <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/08/14/social-nav-menus-part-2\">social links menu</a> concept. I just took that concept and applied it to SVG icons rather than icon fonts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All the main SVG-related functions can be found in the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/inc/icon-functions.php\">inc/icon-functions.php file</a>. It’s well-documented in the code, but here’s a summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include the SVG sprite file via the <code>wp_footer</code> hook.</li>\n<li><code>twentyseventeen_get_svg()</code> function returns the SVG icon markup. In most cases, the SVG icon is injected in template files or via hooks and filters. In some cases, the SVG icon is injected via JavaScript.</li>\n<li>Default markup looks like this: <code>&lt;svg class=\"icon icon-name\" aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\"&gt; &lt;use href=\"#icon-name\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#icon-name\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt; &lt;/svg&gt;</code>.</li>\n<li>Note that we could use the absolute path to the SVG file in the <code>href</code> attribute of the use element. In that case:\n<ul>\n<li>there is no need to inject icons via the <code>wp_footer</code> hook.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/Keyamoon/svgxuse\">svgxuse</a> JS polyfill must be used, because Internet Explorer doesn’t support external files referenced in the <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element.</li>\n<li>This method helps caching the SVG sprite file.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>By default, all icons are decorative, but I insisted we show how to use non-decorative icons in an accessible way. Check the examples in the aforementioned <code>twentyseventeen_get_svg()</code> function.</li>\n<li>We replace the default icon for supported social media links by using the <code>walker_nav_menu_start_el</code> filter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Open source rocks</h3>\n<p>WordPress default themes are one of the best themes out there and they set an example how to use new WordPress features. The reason for this is simple.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default themes gets lots of love and attention.</li>\n<li>Many talented people contribute to default themes. <a href=\"https://davidakennedy.com/2016/12/07/dear-twenty-seventeen-contributors/\">Twenty Seventeen had over 100 contributors</a> and we thank you all!</li>\n<li>Default themes are tested before release in many platforms and browsers. And default themes are used on so many sites that any remaining bugs will be found after the release.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Building default themes really is a community driven project. I&#8217;d like to say extra thanks for couple of people.</p>\n<h4>Special thank you</h4>\n<p>Any web project needs good leadership, design, and code. Those were all covered in Twenty Seventeen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy\">David A. Kennedy</a> was leading the project and kept everything rolling. He had a really friendly touch and he was open to ideas. At the same time he wasn&#8217;t afraid to make decisions; for example, a flexbox layout was rejected for this theme.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/melchoyce\">Mel Choyce</a> created the modern, business looking design. She wrote a great article <a href=\"https://choycedesign.com/2016/12/07/behind-the-scenes-of-twenty-seventeen/\">with her behind the scenes take</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurelfulford\">Laurel Fulford</a> was the primary coding lead. She seem to have a solution for every new feature and brought Mel&#8217;s design to life with detailed code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last but not least, remember <a href=\"http://mor10.com/\">Morten Rand-Hendriksen</a>, the one that opened the SVG icon issue that caught my eye?</p>\n<p>He was pretty happy with the end result.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brad_frost\">@brad_frost</a> the SVG icon system solution by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samikeijonen\">@samikeijonen</a> embedded in the new Twenty Seventeen theme in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash\">#WordPress</a> is pure genius</p>\n<p>&mdash; MortenRandHendriksen (@mor10) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/805808154520883200\">December 5, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Who knows if I would’ve contributed if it wasn’t for him posting that.

The free and open certificate authority focuses on lowering the complexity of setting up TLS encryption by making the process more automated. It came <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/lets-encrypt-is-now-out-of-beta\" target=\"_blank\">out of beta</a> in April 2016 and the number of certificates issued per day has grown steadily since then.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the start of 2016, Let’s Encrypt certificates had been available to the public for less than a month and we were supporting approximately 240,000 active (unexpired) certificates,&#8221; said Josh Aas, Executive Director of the non-profit Internet Security Research Group (ISRG). &#8220;Now we’re frequently issuing that many new certificates in a single day while supporting more than 20,000,000 active certificates in total. We’ve issued more than a million certificates in a single day a few times recently.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lets-encrypt-2016.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lets-encrypt-2016.png?resize=1025%2C503&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64920\" /></a></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s Encrypt operates as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and has received more than three dozen corporate <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/sponsors/\" target=\"_blank\">sponsorships</a> and grants, but funds for the coming year have fallen short. In November, Let&#8217;s Encrypt launched a <a href=\"https://www.generosity.com/community-fundraising/make-a-more-secure-web-with-let-s-encrypt\" target=\"_blank\">crowdfunding campaign</a> to cover the cost of one month of operating expenses. So far, the campaign has raised more than $100K towards its $200K fundraising goal.</p>\n<h3>Let&#8217;s Encrypt is Growing Fastest with Smaller, Previously-Unencrypted Sites</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s Encrypt is used with some larger organizations, such as WordPress.com, OVH, Shopify, Akamai, and Dreamhost, but the vast majority of users are smaller entities that were not previously encrypted. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a founding sponsor of the certificate authority, most of Let&#8217;s Encrypt&#8217;s growth has not come from taking customers away from competitors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nOne of the ways Let&#8217;s Encrypt has been helping to secure the web is by making it easy and affordable for sites that have never had certs before to turn on secure HTTPS connections, and for software systems to start enabling HTTPS automatically and by default. Our free certificates may be more likely to be left unused than expensive certificates, and less expert webmasters may accidentally duplicate certificates—but that’s part of making HTTPS integration available to more webmasters across a range of resource and skill levels. Statistics suggest that most of our growth has come not at the expense of other CAs, but from giving previously unencrypted sites their first-ever certificates.</p></blockquote>\n<p>EFF analyzed various sources of usage statistics and estimates that <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/lets-encrypt-largest-certificate-authority-web\" target=\"_blank\">Let&#8217;s Encrypt is now the largest certificate authority on the web</a>. Its rapid adoption has spurred impressive progress towards getting the entire web encrypted. Let&#8217;s Encrypt tracks progress by measuring the percentage of page loads using HTTPS, as seen by browsers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;According to Firefox Telemetry, the Web has gone from approximately 39% of page loads using HTTPS each day to just about 49% during the past year,&#8221; Aas said in Let&#8217;s Encrypt&#8217;s <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/2017/01/06/le-2016-in-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">2016 in Review</a> report. &#8220;We’re incredibly close to a Web that is more encrypted than not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The proliferation of Let&#8217;s Encrypt <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/\" target=\"_blank\">client options</a> in 2016 puts the certificate authority in an even better position to continue driving web encryption in 2017. Aas attributes last year&#8217;s progress to many organizations advocating for HTTPS and working to get their sites encrypted. His team has grown from four full-time employees to nine, and he anticipates that 2017 will be a year of even greater growth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Much of the infrastructure and many of the plans necessary for a 100% encrypted Web came into being or solidified in 2016,&#8221; Aas said. &#8220;More and more hosting providers and CDNs are supporting HTTPS with one click or by default, often without additional fees. It has never been easier for people and organizations running their own sites to find the tools, services, and information they need to move to HTTPS.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 07 Jan 2017 21:42:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: How Do You Educate People New to WordPress?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=64890\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"https://wptavern.com/how-do-you-educate-people-new-to-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5213:\"<p>When a friend of mine asked for suggestions on what he should use to create a new site, I suggested WordPress. It is well supported, has an amazing community, and a ton of free themes and plugins to choose from. After getting WordPress installed on a new webhosting account, I left him be to see what issues he would run into and how he would configure the site.</p>\n<p>After noticing the site was loading slowly three weeks later, I obtained admin access to try to determine what the problem was. The first thing I did was check which plugins he installed. One of the plugins added the ability to embed YouTube videos on the site using shortcodes. My friend was unaware that WordPress has <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds\">oEmbed support</a> which allows users to easily embed videos by pasting the URL into the editor.</p>\n<p>He also installed a couple of other plugins that mimicked core functionality. He was unaware that WordPress does most of the things he wants without the need for plugins.</p>\n<h2>Page Builder Shenanigans</h2>\n<p>After activating a theme that was compatible with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sportspress/\">SportsPress</a> plugin, he installed the <a href=\"http://www.getmotopress.com/plugins/content-editor/\">MotoPress Content Editor</a>. MotoPress Content Editor is a front-end page builder that enables users to visually construct pages. The front page of the site was a long vertical column filled with information that mimicked blog posts.</p>\n<p>Because he didn&#8217;t understand how WordPress works, he forgot to configure the site to display the latest posts instead of using a front page. What he ended up doing is recreating the blog post layout on the static front page using the MotoPress Content Editor. He also added a lot of page builder elements such as YouTube videos to the page which was a contributing factor to the site&#8217;s poor loading times.</p>\n<p>Page builders are a tool that can make building sites and pages more convenient, but in the wrong hands, they can help users <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-visual-page-and-website-builders-make-it-easy-to-create-ugly-sites\">ruin their sites</a>. I replaced the video elements with a text widget that displays the latest video from a YouTube channel. Since he was mimicking the blog post layout on a static page, I configured the site to display the latest blog posts first.</p>\n<p>Once I fixed these issues, I removed the page builder and explained to my friend why it was unnecessary. He was recreating WordPress functionality and doing unnecessary work without realizing it.</p>\n<p>This experience makes me wonder how many other newer WordPress users end up in a similar situation. They don&#8217;t know what WordPress is capable of out-of-the-box and they end up installing a myriad of plugins with descriptions that sound similar to the features they want. I spent about a week undoing all of the work my friend did in three. Had I not stepped in, the site would likely not scale and its performance would decrease further.</p>\n<h2>Getting New Users Started on the Right Track</h2>\n<p>In early 2015, a community initiative dubbed <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/05/4-2-community-initiative-nux-working-group/\">NUX Working Group</a> was created to brainstorm ideas on how to improve the new user experiences throughout the WordPress admin. While the group initially had a head of steam, it lost a lot of momentum last year. I&#8217;d like to see it re-emerge and work in concert with the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-tech-and-design-leads-for-new-focus-based-development-cycle\">focus-based approach</a> to developing WordPress this year.</p>\n<p>How can WordPress explain to new users what its capable of without drowning them in technical information? Is it feasible to create something that caters to the majority without explaining every feature in detail? <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.3\">Admin Pointers</a> were introduced in WordPress 3.3 and while they&#8217;re typically used to introduce new features in a release, they don&#8217;t act as a guided tour to what WordPress can do.</p>\n<p>Education is likely a key component to improving the new user experience. WordPress.com has a <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.com/get-started/\">12-step beginner&#8217;s guide</a> that walks people through the process of configuring and customizing their sites. For self-hosted WordPress users, there&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/New_To_WordPress_-_Where_to_Start\">New to WordPress &#8211; Where to Start guide</a> that covers what WordPress is, choosing a host, and considerations to keep in mind. However, much of the information is technical in nature.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a consultant or coach who works with people new to WordPress, how do you handle the educational part of your projects? What are the most common roadblocks that they encounter? Do you have a custom-made getting started guide or do you forward them to a site with video tutorials like <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress.TV</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wp101.com/\">WP101</a>?</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Jan 2017 19:19:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"WPTavern: Incubator WordCamp Denpasar a Success\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=64903\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com/incubator-wordcamp-denpasar-a-success\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4625:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/taylor-lovett.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/taylor-lovett.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-64907\" /></a>This post was contributed by guest author Taylor Lovett. Lovett is based in the Washington DC area, is the Director of Web Engineering at <a href=\"https://10up.com\" target=\"_blank\">10up</a>, creator of ElasticPress, and general open source enthusiast.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In February 2016, the <a href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Foundation</a> announced the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/experiment-wordcamp-incubator/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp incubator program</a>, focused on spreading WordPress and open source values to remote areas of the world through extra hands-on support to first time WordCamps. WordCamp Denpasar, which took place in Bali’s capital city, is the first of three camps to be supported as a part of the program — other WordCamps include Harare and Medellín. As Director of Web Engineering at <a href=\"https://10up.com\" target=\"_blank\">10up</a>, I was sent to attend and speak at the inaugural event. Our company values open source projects and the WordPress community, so we’re proud to support emerging communities by attending events like this.</p>\n<p>The incubator program supports WordCamps by providing them with an experienced organizer. In Denpasar’s case, Rocio Valdivia, a Community Wrangler for Automattic, was the WordCamp Incubator sponsored organizer. According to Ivan Kristianto, the lead organizer for WordCamp Denpasar, “Rocio was a hands-on consultant provided by the WordPress Foundation to help incubate the camp. She helped [us] in budgeting, managing the organizers, submission timelines, and more”.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Denpasar attracted 180 attendees, twice the initial goal. Many attendees came from other parts of Indonesia to attend the Camp, which bubbled with an aura of excitement as Indonesia has not had a WordCamp in over three years. The venue, the <a href=\"http://www.sofitel.com/gb/hotel-5551-the-royal-beach-seminyak-bali-mgallery-collection/index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Beach Seminyak Hotel</a>, was of ample size and served the crowd well. There was a single session track, mixed with user, business, and developer topics. Lunch included a nice buffet featuring local Balinese cuisine. Overall, the WordCamp attendance, venue, and amenities were quite impressive.</p>\n<p>The speaker lineup was diverse, with speakers from Indonesia, Australia, Europe, Japan, and the United States. Attendees were extremely enthusiastic throughout the sessions and actively engaged in questions. I was last to speak, presenting on <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2016/twenty-sixteen-react-nodeifywp/\" target=\"_blank\">NodeifyWP and Twenty Sixteen React</a>. WordCamp Denpasar was the debut presentation of our new isomorphic JavaScript framework. The crowd was extremely excited to hear my presentation and attendees were grateful 10up choose Bali as a first occasion to show the framework. After my talk, I received more questions than could fit in the allotted time slot.</p>\n<p>In the weeks after the Camp, I talked with Rocio about the overall success of the event and Incubator program as a whole. Rocio believed the WordCamp went extremely well. She cited some key events that followed the inaugural camp:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The local Indonesian meetup group has grown to more than 50 new members across different groups.</li>\n<li>The existing WP Meetup Bekasi group in Indonesia has applied to join the Meetup chapter program.</li>\n<li>The non-active WP Meetup of Jakarta has now two members interested in re-activating the group and have applied to join the chapter program. They are also interested in organizing WordCamp Jakarta 2017.</li>\n<li>The WordPress Foundation has received an application for organizing WordCamp Ubud in 2017 (one hour from Denpasar) which is in pre-planning now.</li>\n<li>A WP Indonesia Slack channel is being created to connect the whole community in the country.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Clearly, WordCamp Denpasar has had a positive effect on the Indonesian WordPress community. As more areas of the world getting involved contributing to and using WordPress, the project’s internationalization and diversity improves. If Denpasar is any indication, expanding the incubator program to more areas of the world will have long-lasting benefits within the entire WordPress community.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Jan 2017 18:59:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WPTavern: Matt Mullenweg Announces Tech and Design Leads for New Focus-Based Development Cycle\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=64862\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-tech-and-design-leads-for-new-focus-based-development-cycle\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7237:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sharpened-pencil.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sharpened-pencil.jpg?resize=960%2C542&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64886\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/JLXDNN5BNE\">Angelina Litvin</a>\n<p>WordPress core development is kicking off in 2017 with the new focus-based development process that Matt Mullenweg announced during the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle\" target=\"_blank\">2016 State of the Word</a>. The new approach to releases shifts WordPress from the familiar time-based release cycle to one that is more project-based. The idea is that design and user testing will lead the way and upcoming releases will ship when significant user-facing improvements are ready.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg, who will serve as the overall product lead for 2017, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/01/04/focus-tech-and-design-leads/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> tech and design leads for each of the three focus areas: the REST API, the editor, and the customizer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the REST API we’re going to work on getting first party wp-admin usage of the new endpoints, and hopefully replace all of the core places where we still use admin-ajax,&#8221; Mullenweg said. The REST API team nominated Ryan McCue and K.Adam White to take the lead on the objectives Mullenweg outlined, as well as infrastructure and endpoint performance, security, and improvements to authentication options and documentation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The editor will endeavor to create a new page and post building experience that makes writing rich posts effortless, and has &#8216;blocks&#8217; to make it easy what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or &#8216;mystery meat&#8217; embed discovery,&#8221; Mullenweg said. Automattic employees Matias Ventura and Joen Asmussen will be taking point on the editor.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-ui/\" target=\"_blank\">Shortcake UI</a> feature plugin is one attempt at giving the existing shortcodes feature a more user-friendly interface, but contributors are also exploring other ideas for simplifying the experience of adding rich content to posts. Ella Van Dorpe recently posted an idea for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/12/24/idea-uniform-resource-identifiers-as-an-alternative-to-shortcodes/\" target=\"_blank\">using uniform resource identifiers as an alternative to shortcodes</a> in certain use cases. This would work similar to <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress&#8217; implementation of oEmbed</a> where data is stored elsewhere and embedded in a post using a URL.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s proposed direction for the customizer team is to &#8220;help out the editor at first, then shift to bring those fundamental building blocks into something that could allow customization &#8216;outside of the box&#8217; of post_content, including sidebars and possibly even an entire theme.&#8221; Weston Ruter and Mel Choyce will be taking the lead on the customizer focus.</p>\n<p>Ruter and contributors have been working on a project called <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-js-widgets\" target=\"_blank\">JS Widgets</a> that uses the Customize API to power the next generation of JavaScript-widgets in core. It opens the door for managing widgets via the REST API and ties in nicely with all three focus areas.</p>\n<p>A preliminary discussion on upcoming Customizer priorities cropped up in the comments. Nick Halsey, co-maintainer of the customize component, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/01/04/focus-tech-and-design-leads/#comment-31891\" target=\"_blank\">responded</a> to the proposal of having the customizer help out the editor at first. He believes the best approach is to create the new editor within the Customize API, giving it live previews from the start.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Improving the editor within an &#8216;admin&#8217; interface that lacks live preview doesn’t address the fundamental problems with the current content editing experience and creates something that still has to be entirely rebuilt and reimagined within a live preview context eventually,&#8221; Halsey said. &#8220;If the editor is built on the Customize API first, rather than rethinking the editor and then bringing it into the live preview API, the customize and editor contributors would be able to join forces to focus on improving the content editing experience much more effectively.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see what direction Mullenweg and the leads decide to take in the foundational task of architecting the new editing experience. Mullenweg made it clear in the State of the Word address that he would like to see Calypso or a similar interface replace wp-admin in the future. However, Calypso was not built using the Customize API, WordPress&#8217; own single page application admin interface that plugins and themes already widely support.</p>\n<p>After WordCamp US, I asked Mullenweg about his intentions for Calypso in relationship to WordPress core. He said the application was &#8220;designed to be in core someday,&#8221; which is one reason they selected the same license and made it open source.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My real hope is that it is something that is ready for core someday &#8211; both Calypso the interface and the concept.&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I said Calypso or something like it. There&#8217;s obviously a lot of WordPress.com stuff in Calypso that will never be in core. If we think of a wp-admin replacement, it would be replacing wp-admin with the parts that Calypso does that are the same thing, kind of more of the my sites section of it. But I do believe the future of a great wp-admin experience is JavaScript &#8211; probably React, talking to APIs, super fast, and maybe even working offline.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Automattic is actively recruiting popular plugin authors to make their plugins Calypso-aware. Demonstrating the application&#8217;s interoperability with the WordPress plugin ecosystem is a must before Calypso can be considered a promising replacement for the WordPress admin. In the meantime, the foundation for a new page and post building experience is being laid with consideration for how the customizer can improve the editor.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg responded to comments on the post indicating that feature plugins or other improvements to WordPress outside of the three focus areas would need to continue on as plugins for the time being. However, performance improvements may be included in minor releases.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What goes in a minor release will broaden a bit, which I know is something we have to approach carefully, but performance is very important and improvements will be something I will consider for being in a minor release,&#8221; Mullenweg said. Contributors are currently working on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-7-1/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 4.7.1</a>, which is planned for release on Tuesday, January 10.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Jan 2017 00:00:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"WPTavern: Micro.blog Surpasses Kickstarter Funding Goal, Set to Launch New Social Network for Independent Microblogs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=64805\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:126:\"https://wptavern.com/micro-blog-surpasses-kickstarter-funding-goal-set-to-launch-new-social-network-for-independent-microblogs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6754:\"<p>Developer <a href=\"http://www.manton.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Manton Reece</a> is on a mission to take back short form content for the open web by providing better tools for independent microblogging. Most short form content today is posted through centralized social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, where posts are mixed with promoted content and users have no control of their timelines. There&#8217;s no guarantee that these social networks will be around forever, as many before them have disappeared, eclipsed by new ways to connect online.</p>\n<p>Reece set out to create <a href=\"http://micro.blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Micro.blog</a>, a timeline and publishing platform for the open web, as an alternative social network that encourages more independent writing. He <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing\" target=\"_blank\">launched a Kickstarter campaign</a> to fund the platform along with his work on a book called Indie Microblogging. The project&#8217;s $10K goal was fully funded on the first day and has passed $22,000 on the second day of the campaign.</p>\n<p>Micro.blog has a timeline experience similar to Twitter with replies and favorites, but the main difference is that it is based on RSS, pulling posts from independent sites. Those who don&#8217;t have their own websites will be able to opt for a hosted microblog and map a custom domain. Users with hosted microblogs can post via a web interface that includes a Markdown editor or use the service&#8217;s iPhone app.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/micro-blog-1.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/micro-blog-1.png?resize=1025%2C590&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64853\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Micro.blog Will Integrate with WordPress</h3>\n<p>Reece, who self-hosts <a href=\"http://manton.org/\" target=\"_blank\">his own blog</a> on WordPress, will be launching Micro.blog with full integration for WordPress users, making it easy to cross post between the two platforms. I asked him about the workflow for publishing from WordPress and he said his Indie Microblogging book will contain a section specifically on WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After you&#8217;ve told Micro.blog about your WordPress RSS feed, you can continue to post to your blog as you normally would, although I&#8217;ll have some tips for taking the best advantage of it,&#8221; Reece said. &#8220;There&#8217;s also a native iPhone app for Micro.blog that supports direct posting to WordPress. I&#8217;ve found that it really improves the user experience to have a single app with a timeline experience, replies, favorites, as well as easy posting directly to your own site. But there&#8217;s no requirement to use any specific app.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Reece said he plans to implement a very strict, reverse-chronological timeline for content that users are following. He also does not plan to introduce any algorithms or advertising. Basic accounts will be free and the plan is to sustain the platform with revenue from a paid plan that includes extra features like microblog hosting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One thing that is very important to me is not letting someone you don&#8217;t follow interrupt your timeline with harassment or other replies that aren&#8217;t appropriate,&#8221; Reece said. &#8220;I&#8217;m working on some features around this that I hope will help avoid similar issues that Twitter has faced in its community, for example. So if there are any custom algorithms or curation it will be around trying to deal with abuse before it happens.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Micro.blog platform is currently built using Ruby, Sinatra, Ember.js, MySQL, and Redis. Reece said he is in the process of rewriting some of the app with a more traditional Ruby on Rails setup.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ember didn&#8217;t end up being a great fit for the design,&#8221; Reece said. &#8220;There is also a portion of the microblog publishing engine built on Jekyll, so that themes and data files can be more portable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Micro.blog isn&#8217;t entirely distributed where users host their own &#8220;pods&#8221; like Diaspora, but Reece said he is open to making it more decentralized in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good goal to eventually move to something even more distributed, but it introduces a lot of complexity, which has prevented most of those kind of solutions from taking off,&#8221; Reece said. &#8220;I hope that Micro.blog is a step in the right direction, encouraging people to write more on their own site even for short microblog posts, instead of just Twitter and Facebook, with more open formats and APIs. It&#8217;s more achievable if we can build off of tools like WordPress instead of starting over.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Reece said he thinks WordPress.com (Automattic) is one of only a couple web publishing companies he believes could last 100 years. &#8220;Only 2 companies keep coming to mind: WordPress.com and GitHub,&#8221; he said in a <a href=\"http://mirror.manton.org/2015/09/complete-mirror-of-this-blog.html\" target=\"_blank\">post about mirroring his blog to GitHub</a>. &#8220;I believe both will last for decades, maybe even 100 years, and both embrace the open web in a way that most other centralized web sites do not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During his 14 years of blogging and 10 years of using Twitter, Reece became an advocate for the open web. He said he used to be excited about Twitter and built apps for the platform but grew disillusioned at their approach to locking down the API.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been so focused on writing on Twitter and Facebook that we&#8217;ve gotten away from more independent publishing that makes blogs and the open web great,&#8221; Reece said. &#8220;I think microblogging has a place on the open web, and that posting to a blog and reading posts from friends can have just as great a user experience as using a traditional social network. I&#8217;ve already heard from many people who have been inspired recently to blog again, which is really the main goal of Micro.blog.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing/community\" target=\"_blank\">Micro.blog Kickstarter campaign</a> will end in 27 days. Reece said he was surprised the project was funded so quickly. He plans to work hard over the next month to roll out Micro.blog to everyone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to see how users use the service, how the book can help WordPress users expand their existing blogs, and what developers want to build on the APIs going forward,&#8221; Reece said.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Jan 2017 23:14:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"HeroPress: We Are The Same\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1556\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://heropress.com/essays/we-are-the-same/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9064:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/010417-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: To every woman... we are the same. I am you and you are me.\" /><p><em>Topher asked me to write an article for HeroPress as we sat together in an alcove in the Philly Convention Center. I was in a vulnerable space. My lightning talk at WordCamp US had concluded, and I was settling into the experience of being at another WordCamp. I thought about the life experiences that brought me to my second presentation a year later, and I started to cry. Below is why.</em></p>\n<p>One of my earliest memories is attending my mother&#8217;s graduate school graduation ceremony. It was a huge achievement. I wore a pink frilly dress with afro puffs to her graduation ceremony. I am sure I was gripping someone&#8217;s leg and hiding behind them. Behind my mother, my aunt or maybe my father. I was painfully awkward and shy. Which didn&#8217;t make any sense because my family was constantly telling me, &#8216;Be quiet&#8217;. That could have been their anthem for me. Children were meant to be seen, not heard.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think of that young Sierra Leonean American girl I was, I think back to that day, and wonder what became of her.</p></blockquote>\n<p>She grew taller, much taller, transitioned from pink dresses to a pink bedroom, and, some say, is poised. But she is still painfully awkward. You wouldn&#8217;t know it, but you can catch her at times sitting quietly at an event achingly wishing she were alone and didn’t have to perform.</p>\n<p>I project confidence because I was drafted into an oratory competition in middle school. Something about my voice caught the attention of my middle school teacher Mrs. McNeil. She entered me into one. I don&#8217;t recall what I read or the outcome. I only remember my mom driving me to my competition and her, my sister and I pulling up to a very crowded parking lot. Everything gets fuzzy after we arrived.</p>\n<p>In high school, I didn&#8217;t need to be drafted into public speaking. I had strong ideals and opinions, and when it came to debate competitions I didn&#8217;t need to fit in and be cool. All I had to do was win. I debated as a Junior Statesmen, entered the Essex County Mock Trial competition, and the High School Moot Court Tournament at Princeton University. During 10th or 11th grade I got commendations for my role as a mother whose son died due to someone&#8217;s negligence at school. I argued with the other team’s attorneys. I was distraught. I channeled my inner mother. The judge gave our Mock Trial team extra points because I made the case believable. In 11th grade my partner and I came second place in the Moot Court competition at Princeton.</p>\n<p>I live in Maplewood, New Jersey. It is a town that actively engages its children. Our administration and teachers educate us to be competitive academically and in our extracurricular activities, and to actively seek out opportunities for service.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Teachers tell us we can be great &#8211; and expectations are that we will be great.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is ingrained in us that to whom much is given much is expected. I do the best I can to embody what is expected of me.</p>\n<p>Truthfully, as an African girl, it was wonderful to be educated like this. At home my parents, aunts and uncles expect nothing less. Outside of home and my classes and clubs, I received mixed messages about who I was and what I could achieve. I was one of a handful of Africans in a diverse community. I didn&#8217;t look African or sound African I was told growing up. And I was surprised as a child of how differently I was treated by many of the same color other than my best friend and her family in elementary school. It was fascinating. On one occasion at school I achingly experienced different treatment. A college counselor lost interest in helping me with financial aid when it came up in conversation that I was African. After that conversation she was too busy to meet with me. I went to the head of guidance instead who was fabulous.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Occasions like this make me acutely proud of where my family comes from and the sacrifices my parents made 30 plus years ago when they immigrated here.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I see in them that resilience is a must and that success is accessible through motivation, hard work, focus, education and self-improvement.</p>\n<p>As a child, I hurt at the barriers some put up when I told them I am African. And I still do. At times, we are misunderstood and misrepresented. And it doesn&#8217;t make me any less proud of my Sierra Leonean heritage.</p>\n<p>Three weeks ago, I had dinner with someone I met years ago. I mentioned something related to my heritage. She stopped for a second. She said she was surprised to hear I am African. Her enthusiasm towards me immediately drained. I wasn&#8217;t shocked. I pushed away the feeling of disappointment I feel in these occasions. I acknowledged the difference internally and it didn&#8217;t stop me from enjoying her company. It&#8217;s a situation I&#8217;ve found myself in many, many times.</p>\n<p>I was told I could be great as a child growing up in Maplewood. I let this propel me forward through each obstacle in my way, and I let this make me stand tall as I take on each daunting task before me. I took this with me to every college class and graduate class I have taken even when overpowered by feelings of inadequacy. I have been to events at places where very few people will ever have the chance to go. There are organizations I have worked for that have a competitive selection process. There are certificates I have earned that make me wonder how I gathered the strength to make it through. And there are presentations like the ones I gave at WordCamp US in 2015 and 2016 where I fought through feelings of inadequacy to stand on stage and speak before hundreds of people in the tech industry.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At these times, I think of the little Sierra Leonean American girl in the pink frilly dress with afro puffs, and wonder how she could achieve each one of these accomplishments.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I wonder how she became so warmly embraced by the WordPress community, invited to plan WordCamp NYC at the United Nations in 2016, and invited to be a co-organizer of Meetups in NYC. It reflects how inclusive our community is.</p>\n<p>I think of my gender, my color, and my heritage.</p>\n<p>To every woman &#8211; we are the same. And, even if we glance at each other and look away, I am you and you are me. We can’t let anyone convince us otherwise.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think of the African girl on the continent who doesn’t have the choices and resources I have. I cry for her, and I cry for me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I cry because I may never meet her, never look deeply into her eyes, never tell her that she will be great, give her the resources she needs to fully realize her dreams and give her the space to be embraced by the WordPress community. Make no mistake in this digital age that this little girl is aware of what she doesn’t have, and that she needs us to propel her forward.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: We Are The Same\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=We%20Are%20The%20Same&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwe-are-the-same%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: We Are The Same\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwe-are-the-same%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwe-are-the-same%2F&title=We+Are+The+Same\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: We Are The Same\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/we-are-the-same/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/010417-150x150.jpg&description=We Are The Same\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: We Are The Same\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/we-are-the-same/\" title=\"We Are The Same\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/we-are-the-same/\">We Are The Same</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Jan 2017 12:00:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Winstina Hughes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: W3Techs Ranks WordPress as the Fastest Growing CMS of 2016\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=64826\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/w3techs-ranks-wordpress-as-the-fastest-growing-cms-of-2016\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3019:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/blogging.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/blogging.jpg?resize=960%2C521&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-54799\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/3ZHG0XOIT6\">Luis Llerena</a>\n<p>W3Techs published its <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/blog/entry/web_technologies_of_the_year_2016\" target=\"_blank\">Web Technologies of 2016</a> report today, compiling technologies that saw the largest increase in usage last year. The survey pulls data from the top 10 million sites (according to Alexa rankings) and compares the number of sites for each technology by measuring the difference from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2017.</p>\n<p>W3Techs ranks WordPress as the fastest growing content management system with 58.5% market share. Shopify and Squarespace demonstrated the second and third largest increases in usage. Squarespace is a newcomer to the top three. In <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/blog/entry/web_technologies_of_the_year_2015\" target=\"_blank\">2015</a> the second and third place winners were Drupal and Shopify. WordPress has dominated the top spot every year since 2010.</p>\n<p>CMS usage on the whole saw a 3.3% increase. Of the top 15 CMS&#8217;s only six demonstrated growth, including the aforementioned top three, as well as Joomla, Drupal, and Bitrix, which showed nominal 0.1% increases in market share by the end of 2016. Blogger is on the decline, and the remaining CMS&#8217;s showed no increase or decrease.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cms-usage-2016.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cms-usage-2016.png?resize=1025%2C444&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64832\" /></a></p>\n<p>PHP regained its top ranking among server-side programming languages as the fastest growing in 2016, a title which it temporarily lost to Java in 2015. W3Techs estimates PHP to be used by 82.4% of all websites for which it can detect a server-side programming language.</p>\n<p>Another interesting result of the survey is that &#8220;WordPress Jetpack,&#8221; the stats module in Jetpack, ranks third among the fastest growing traffic analysis tools, trailing Google Analytics and Yandex.Metrika. Jetpack Stats has been on a slow upward trend, rising from 1.6% in 2011 to 4.5% in 2017. The top fastest growing players in this category have repeated several years in a row.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that many Jetpack stats users also use Google Analytics, but these numbers also give a rough idea of Jetpack usage increase, since it is one of the most popular modules in the plugin. According to W3Techs, <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ta-wordpressstats/all/all\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack Stats</a> is used by 6.9% of sites for which it can detect a traffic analysis tool, which it estimates as 4.5% of all websites.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 03 Jan 2017 23:03:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WPTavern: WP-CLI Gets Official WordPress.org Support\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=64789\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-gets-official-wordpress-org-support\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5086:\"<p>The WP-CLI open source project will be coming under the WordPress.org umbrella in 2017. After recent talks with Daniel Bachhuber, WP-CLI&#8217;s official maintainer, Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/12/28/supporting-the-future-of-wp-cli/\" target=\"_blank\">announced WordPress&#8217; support for the project</a>, calling it &#8220;one of the highest impact developments for WP in many years.&#8221; The wp-cli.org website will soon be migrated to WordPress.org and a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/\" target=\"_blank\">CLI Make site</a> with its own P2 is now available to contributors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As we head into 2017, I wanted to make sure that its future is certain for everyone who builds on it, and that the major contributors to the project, chiefly Daniel Bachhuber, are able to work on it even more in the coming year,&#8221; Mullenweg said. Now that the project is part of WordPress.org, Mullenweg said he will be leading a coalition of companies to &#8220;solidify their financial support&#8221; of <a href=\"http://wp-cli.org/blog/the-big-question.html\" target=\"_blank\">the existing fundraising effort</a> that Bachhuber launched in mid-December 2016.</p>\n<p>The logistics of the new funding model haven&#8217;t yet been completely ironed out, but Bachhuber says <a href=\"https://runcommand.io/\" target=\"_blank\">runcommand</a> will not be shutting down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Runcommand&#8217;s sole focus will be to hire people to work on WP-CLI,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This hybrid approach better ensures WP-CLI&#8217;s long-term future (e.g. the project is under the wing of the WordPress project), while also being a creative way for paying for dedicated resources to it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bachhuber explored different funding models for WP CLI throughout 2016 without much success. When discussions about making it an official WordPress core project first began, he was leaning towards keeping WP-CLI operating as an independent project. The new hybrid approach gives companies the opportunity to financially support an official WordPress project via runcommand, where Bachhuber hopes to hire additional maintainers on a part-time basis.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought a lot about funding open source over the last year,&#8221; Bachhuber said. &#8220;In the context of WP-CLI, I came to the conclusion that I didn&#8217;t have confidence in WP-CLI being a completely independent project + financially sustainable business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bachhuber said he feels &#8220;reasonably confident&#8221; about the future of the project after recent developments and hopes to have funding for a few part-time maintainers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think part-time is key because each of us needs to be working / solving problems in the real-world, and then taking those solutions back to the project,&#8221; Bachhuber said. Although many open source projects operate without paying people for contributions, he believes there is an important distinction between maintainers and contributors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Contributors act in a voluntary manner (e.g. contributing code when they have a couple hours free),&#8221; Bachhuber said. &#8220;Maintainers take responsibility for the project, showing up every day, and doing most of the unglamorous work. I think maintainership is an important aspect of a healthy open source project. Everyone has an example of an open source project they use that&#8217;s no longer maintained and how painful it is to be dependent on it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Responses to the news of WP-CLI gaining official WordPress.org support were overwhelmingly positive, as the tool is critical to the WordPress developer community. The decision to have WP-CLI operate under WordPress.org&#8217;s umbrella makes it better positioned to drive the financial support needed to sustain the ongoing burden of maintainership.</p>\n<p>Bachhuber said the current fundraising effort, which is <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-project-launches-patron-support-model-to-fund-ongoing-development\" target=\"_blank\">based on a patron support model</a>, is approximately 1/5 of the way to his funding goal. He is still waiting to hear from a number of large players but the funding drive will remain open indefinitely for now. Bachhuber said they will re-evaluate once they reach the goal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I consider this the best possible outcome of my efforts trying to identify sustainability for the project over the last year,&#8221; Bachhuber said in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/01/03/lets-do-this/\" target=\"_blank\">first post</a> on the Make WordPress CLI site. &#8220;The decision to make WP-CLI an official WordPress project also means there’s a clear path forward for me to invest more of my own time into the <a href=\"http://wp-cli.org/docs/roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\">WP-CLI roadmap</a>. Concurrent with the transition process over the next couple of months, I want to move forward the conversation of how we realize a future where WP-CLI is the fastest way to do anything with WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 03 Jan 2017 06:50:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"HeroPress: Help a HeroPress friend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=1553\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"https://heropress.com/help-heropress-friend/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2334:\"<p>Hey folks, HeroPress contributor Michael Beil is fighting for his life right now.

They’ve just served lunch and I realise I’m stuck. There isn’t enough room to slip out for a bathroom break without tipping my meal and the trolley blocks the aisle.</p>\n<p>I cough and notice I’m tense, what’s going on? I enjoy flying, why should today be any different? Is it that I might be sick? Maybe it’s shovelling clothes off of the dining table into an open suitcase and rushing for a taxi at 6am? Or responding to a client at 11pm then playing Rimworld till 2am knowing I’d be up at 5? Maybe it’s Mr Robot? Anyone who’s seen that show knows it isn’t exactly happy.</p>\n<p>I open my watch up and try the new breathe app. I’ve installed watch apps before but never found much use from them, but this came with the update from Apple this morning so I’ll give it a go. It holds me steady but I’m still tense.</p>\n<p>I put on some music and try to eat some food. Maybe that’s the problem? I get anxious sometimes about food, it can get me in trouble. During speaker submissions for WordCamp Europe Sophia I wrote a mini rant about sandwiches and labeling. Siobhan thought it was funny, but I should know better. It was that year I saw a talk on depression.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen several people speak about it, but right now I’m anxious, and I’m typing. After WCEU 2016 I promised Topher I’d write an article for him, and I’ve been occupied. The last month or so, I’ve been working and not taking care of myself. I’m not sure if I&#8217;m actually sick or if this is burn out. I’ve noticed aches in my hands, it worries me.</p>\n<p>I think about what writing this will do. My WP Tavern article ranks higher than me on Facebook search.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There’s nothing like an article on anxiety popping up when a date searches your name. I don’t want to be known as the mental health guy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But a promise is a promise. When I last did this people were supportive. They said nice things, they talked about their own feelings and gave talks. Nobody sent their pity.</p>\n<p>The food tray’s gone now, I’m not sure how I feel but I know there’s 2 Automatticians in front of me and 2 to the side. We land in Vancouver in 6 hours for the grand meet up, and I know I’ll get a big hug from several people. They’re genuine nice people, and I’ve come to realise the WordPress community doesn’t tolerate bad actors. We share what we think is important, what people need to hear.</p>\n<p>I’ve got one more episode of Mr Robot, I’ll think about those I see at WordCamps and close this app. It isn’t long before I can talk in person.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I’m home! Despite a total lack of scrambled eggs on toast in not one, not two, but three major international airports, I’ve finally returned home. My friends dragged me jet lagged to a play entitled “The pacifists answer to the war on cancer” where a jolly sequinned cancer cell sings a song moments after a woman screams in agony. I got to sing happy birthday to my family with a room of Automatticians, climb a mountain, it was fun!</p>\n<p>I think about what I’ve written, and wish I’d been more positive.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Life can be scary but I’m surrounded by people who want to help.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes that’s family, or friends, but user groups and events help too. These people have the same problems and worries I do, and deal with them in many ways.</p>\n<p>Importantly, they’re willing to talk about their problems in front of hundreds of people, and share their solutions. I feel it’s something that isn’t mentioned often enough. Burnout and stress is rampant in our industry, and I’m glad people are stepping up to the challenge.</p>\n<p>I’m a lead organiser for a WordCamp Manchester now. That means I can’t speak at my own conference, but I’m hoping to get a good talk or two. Maybe things aren’t so terrible? Maybe next time I’ll get a window seat.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Over The Atlantic\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Over%20The%20Atlantic&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fover-the-atlantic%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Over The Atlantic\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fover-the-atlantic%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fover-the-atlantic%2F&title=Over+The+Atlantic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Over The Atlantic\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/over-the-atlantic/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/122816-150x150.jpg&description=Over The Atlantic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Over The Atlantic\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/over-the-atlantic/\" title=\"Over The Atlantic\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/over-the-atlantic/\">Over The Atlantic</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 12:00:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Tom Nowell\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"Matt: Christmas Music: Leslie Odom Jr.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47002\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://ma.tt/2016/12/christmas-music-leslie-odom-jr/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:629:\"<p>I love Christmas music, and <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2013/12/christmas-jazz-music/\">most years</a> I like to recommend a Christmas music album that is a bit more jazz or has something interesting about it.

The meta team worked quickly to put the new design in place in time for the holidays.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While this is only the first iteration, the plan is to continue design and development to create something truly amazing,&#8221; Mark Uraine said in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/12/22/new-homepage-is-launched/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>. &#8220;This is the first step toward that goal.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wordpress-homepage-new-design-e1482443742169.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wordpress-homepage-new-design-e1482443742169.png?resize=1025%2C854&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64722\" /></a></p>\n<p>The header and footer have been kept from the previous design. According to meta team member Samuel Wood, matching them to the new design is beyond the scope of this first iteration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The header and footer are global pieces,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;Redesigning them, in any way, will have to be part of a much larger effort in redesigning, well, everything. The entire site would need adjustments to adjust them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Uraine <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/12/12/new-homepage-redesign/#comment-8739\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a previous post that there are iterations underway for a new, more minimal header that better aligns with the new homepage style.</p>\n<p>Feedback on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/12/12/new-homepage-redesign/\" target=\"_blank\">initial draft</a> included notes on the copy, particularly the &#8220;Meet WordPress&#8221; headline. One person commented on it not being inclusive of people who have already met WordPress and are returning. Also, a few found the tagline to be too narrow: <em>WordPress is open source software you can use to create a beautiful website, blog, or app.</em> Some suggested the inclusion of other use cases, such as store, forum, and membership site. These ideas have not been incorporated but they were recognized by the design team in the comments on the initial draft.</p>\n<p>The homepage redesign went from sketches to prototype to live on WordPress.org in a matter of a couple weeks. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive so far, and most see it as a huge improvement. The new design should receive a great deal more exposure now that it&#8217;s live, which will hopefully bring in more varied perspectives towards making it extraordinary in future iterations.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 23:13:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"Matt: New .org Homepage\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=46996\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://ma.tt/2016/12/new-org-homepage/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:410:\"<p>For the first time in&#8230; many years, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org has a new home page</a>.

In order to achieve this goal, we have created a transparent market which makes it easier for buyers and sellers to find each other and where the sale of the business can be processed in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect. Based on our expertise, we offer the parties a helping hand and guide them through the challenging process with many pitfalls along the way.\r\n\r\nWith great commitment and dedication, our customers have created significant value: They have set up a company and created many jobs. Customers, suppliers and employees rely on the existence of the company as a going concern. A large part of the assets is tied up in the company and can only be realized by selling the business. We are in the same boat and have the same goals as our customers. Thanks to a large number of potential buyers, we offer our customers the opportunity to select and implement the option which works best for them.\r\n\r\nThe benefit for the economy is enormous. It has helped to save over 1,000 jobs, and our customers have received well over EUR 350 million thanks to successful sale of companies.\r\n\r\nCompanies are works of art, and we are committed to conserving them.','Mission','','publish','closed','closed','','mission','','','2016-01-20 12:21:47','2016-01-20 12:21:47','',7,'http://localhost/startupbroker/?page_id=11',2,'page','',0),(12,1,'2015-12-18 14:00:28','2015-12-18 14:00:28','','Mission','','inherit','closed','closed','','11-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 14:00:28','2015-12-18 14:00:28','',11,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/11-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(13,1,'2015-12-18 14:01:05','2015-12-18 14:01:05','<h1>Buying and selling companies successfully</h1>\r\n<h2>Start Up Broker – Best Practice Guide</h2>\r\n<table class=\"content_text\" border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/BBBookCover.jpg\" alt=\"Business Broker Buch: Unternehmen erfolgreich kaufen und verkaufen\" border=\"0\" /></td>\r\n<td>Book bound, 238 pages, Language German, 2012\r\nOrell Füssli VerlagCHF 59.- including VAT\r\n(+ Shipping costs)\r\n<div class=\"callToAction_button\"><a class=\"callToAction_buttonText\" href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/tabid/62/Default.aspx?ct=book\">Order</a></div></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table class=\"content_text\" border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Authors:</td>\r\n<td>Andreas Schubert, Reto Meli, Richard Jauch, Fabian Rudin, Jérôme Andermatt (longstanding employee at Start Up Broker LC)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Contents:</td>\r\n<td>Every year 5000 small and medium companies are sold in Europe.

Once you have proved that you are successful, we will discuss together what kind of further steps you can take in your career.\r\n\r\nIt is not important to know everything right from the start; however, you must be willing to learn and to make progress.

It was fireworks through all the negotiations and discussions, thanks to you both I have come through everything so well.  The great result was awesome.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mrs. Graber, ex flower shop \"le clou\", Zurich</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>At first, I was skeptical as I believe that I am myself a good salesman and do not need help. I also found it expensive. Preparing company presentations by using the figures from the annual report was very interesting. After I had given you the mandate I found the total support and the quick sale very agreeable. Now, after the sale, I have to say that I have been very satisfied with your work. Thanks again.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mr. P. Gutenberg, ex Bakrona Zurich AG</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Thank you very much for your help and your big effort. Of course I will recommend Start Up Broker LC whenever I can.  It is still difficult to say but I am looking forward to the next cooperation, you never know.\r\n\r\n<cite>Ercole Fusco, ex Fusco Plumbing GmbH</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Working together with Start Up Broker LC was always a pleasure. The reception was very courteous, the execution of the work professional and quick. What I appreciated were the clear understandings which Mr. Schubert repeated after each meeting, so that everyone knew exactly what was meant. The strategies for the sale of my company were supported by a tightly led web portal, the presentation of which shows many years\' experience and is set up in a contemporary manner. Discretion was always a top priority; every interested party was bound to observe confidentiality. During the negotiations Mr. Schubert had the necessary calmness, which almost everyone in the position of selling their company is lacking. Also, a high level of know how is a very important factor which Start Up Broker LC have. I can therefore only recommend engaging the services of Start Up Broker LC when selling companies and for succession planning.\r\nI am convinced that success is not only achieved through ideas, strategies, goal settings and figures, it requires a human being who is also emotionally involved. Emotional decisions are the strength which is in us and which needs to be considered just as much as intelligence. From my point of view I have been able to experience this combination from Start Up Broker LC. It also touched me, that when I collected my documents after the sale, the team came together to congratulate me on my success. I felt happy after each visit; it also had something glorious about it because I was one step closer to my success. I would like to thank everyone for the exciting and wonderful time.\r\n\r\n<cite>Markus Anderegg, ex AM Caretaker</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>I wish you much success with selling. It is clear for me that you are the best and that I will recommend you anytime.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mrs. F.

Niederberger, ex Londonhouse</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>No matter how it will develop, we have to thank you very much. We have been independent for almost two decades and we have experienced quite a lot. Your efficiency, paired with understanding and friendliness, is unique.\r\nContinue to work like this. We will make it up to you by referring as many as possible independent company owners wanting to sell to you. I hope that at least in this way we can stay in touch.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mr. Hoehler, Buyer Gallery Joy AG, Zurich</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Firstly: Compliments for the home page, compliments for your efficient way of working, compliments for the excellent documentation.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mr. R.W., interested party, Fitness Centre Move, Zurich</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Thank you very much for the prompt delivery of the documents regarding the company. How someone works says a lot about a person and his character.

I have seen the programme on Cash TV and after visiting your website I would like to congratulate you on this idea. As you know, first impressions count and remain. Should I have a company to sell, or would want to by one, I will come and see you.

In contrast to this is the Share Deal.</dd><dt><dfn>Asset Stripping</dfn></dt><dd>Sale of assets or sub-areas of an acquired company immediately after its acquisition. Typical motives are either the financing of the purchase price or the opportunity that the total value can be raised through the sale of individual parts. However, the tax consequences should be taken into account.</dd><dt><dfn>Assets</dfn></dt><dd>A company\'s Assets are the sum of all factors of production required by the company in cash, all their rights (e.g. patents, licenses) and material resources (e.g. raw materials, machinery, buildings, land). A distinction must be made between fixed assets and current assets.</dd><dt><dfn>Assets ratio 1</dfn></dt><dd>Provides information about how high the equity is in the ratio of fixed assets.</dd><dt><dfn>Assets ratio 2</dfn></dt><dd>Provides information about how high the equity is plus the long-term debt in the ratio of fixed assets.</dd><dt><dfn>Averaging Method</dfn></dt><dd>The term Averaging Method covers several methods of business valuation. Here, the yield value and the intrinsic value of a company are recorded. The determination of the value of the company is carried out in different ways with a different but fixed weighting of the values in the averaging. In Switzerland, the profitability is used twice and the asset value is used once to calculate the value of the company. The Stuttgart-based method uses the profitability once and the asset value twice for the calculation. The Berlin-based methods both values weighted equally</dd><dt><dfn>Benchmark</dfn></dt><dd>Benchmarking refers to the comparison of the performance of one’s own company with that of other companies. The performance counter of the other company is known as a Benchmark. The aim of such a comparison is to uncover opportunities for improvement and competitive disadvantages and ultimately to increase the performance of one’s own company.</dd><dt><dfn>Break-even-Point</dfn></dt><dd>Time when the breakeven point is exceeded and a profit is realized or the level of revenue, which would cover the proceeds of the fixed and variable costs.</dd><dt><dfn>Bridge Financing</dfn></dt><dd>Bridge financing is a generic term made by credit institutions for short-term or intermediate pre-financing of certain transactions (real estate purchase, company purchase) until the final follow-up financing.</dd><dt><dfn>Burn Rate</dfn></dt><dd>Represents the time until a company has used the capital provided for it (the term originated during the Internet bubble at the turn of the millennium). The Burn Rate is of great importance particularly for start-up companies. The company\'s financial resources decrease in the initial phase of the company because of high fixed costs with only a low turnover.</dd><dt><dfn>Business Angel</dfn></dt><dd>A wealthy individual (usually experienced entrepreneurs) who support young companies with capital as they are founded and/or through active support (coaching or management assistance) and contacts (they are rewarded through shareholdings in the company).</dd><dt><dfn>Business plan</dfn></dt><dd>A description of the business model of a young company to present to investors, this includes information about product concept, market, team, management of future operations and economic analyses, etc.</dd><dt><dfn>Buy-and-build Strategy</dfn></dt><dd>The acquisition of several companies in order to build a larger group/holding company.</dd><dt><dfn>CAGR</dfn></dt><dd>Stands for Compound Annual Growth Rate. A growth rate is defined as the average relative increase of a variable per unit of time.</dd><dt><dfn>CAPEX</dfn></dt><dd>The abbreviation CAPEX comes from the Anglo-Saxon term of Capital Expenditure. This term refers to the long-term assets of a company such as machinery, buildings or computer systems.</dd><dt><dfn>Cash Flow</dfn></dt><dd>The Cash Flow from operating activities (Operating Cash Flow) includes all deposits and payments associated with the actual provision of services of the company. Examples are the sale of products or the payment of wages. The Cash Flow from investment activities (Cash Flow from Investment) consists of the deposits and withdrawals, which result from the investment or disinvestment of the company. Examples include the installation of a new production facility or the sale of a warehouse. The Cash Flow from financing activities (Cash Flow from Financing) includes all those deposits and withdrawals, which are related to the financing of business activities. Examples include interest payments or the payment of dividends, but also a borrowing or capital repayment.</dd><dt><dfn>Cash Flow Deal</dfn></dt><dd>Traditional form of the Management Buyout (MBO), which is financed largely on the basis of the generated cash of a company. Key variable is the Cash Flow from which the return of the funds received and the service rate must be settled.</dd><dt><dfn>Cash Ratio</dfn></dt><dd>Corresponds to the Quick Ratio. It is the ratio of liquid assets to the current liabilities of a company and therefore allows an analysis of how a company can meet its current short-term payment obligations solely by its liquid assets. Accounts receivable (debtors) are not included.</dd><dt><dfn>Cash Value</dfn></dt><dd>The cash value or present value of the item refers to the expected value of a future cash amount. The cash value is obtained by discounting the future cash equivalent amount, with a capital interest, the expression of an alternative achievable interest rate.</dd><dt><dfn>Chief Executive Officer (CEO)</dfn></dt><dd>Chief Executive Officer</dd><dt><dfn>Chief Financial Officer (CFO)</dfn></dt><dd>Chief Financial Officer</dd><dt><dfn>Chief Organisation Officer (COO)</dfn></dt><dd>Chief Organisation Officer</dd><dt><dfn>Chief Technological Officer (CTO)</dfn></dt><dd>Chief Technological Officer</dd><dt><dfn>Co-Investment</dfn></dt><dd>Stake in a company with a minority share, whereby the support is given through a Lead Investor and thus reduces the support costs for the Co-Investor.</dd><dt><dfn>Co-Lead Investments</dfn></dt><dd>Stake in a company at the same level as that of the Lead Investor. The latter assumes the true support of the investee.</dd><dt><dfn>Collection Period</dfn></dt><dd>The accounts receivable period provides information on the time it takes the customer to make payments. It corresponds to the time between invoicing and payment by the customer. The higher the retention time of the debtor company, the slower the payment, the less favourable the liquidity.</dd><dt><dfn>Confidentiality Agreement</dfn></dt><dd>Also Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA). Usually agreed on during the transfer of business plans and company presentations to third parties. The prospective buyer agrees that he will not share information with third parties.</dd><dt><dfn>Consortium</dfn></dt><dd>Group of all supervising banks in the IPO.</dd><dt><dfn>Consortium Leader</dfn></dt><dd>Leading bank in the IPO of a company.</dd><dt><dfn>Contribution Margin</dfn></dt><dd>The contribution margin is the cost and performance calculation, the difference between the proceeds generated (revenue) and the variable costs. It is therefore the amount available to cover fixed costs.</dd><dt><dfn>Co-Venturing</dfn></dt><dd>Stake in a company by several investors, one of whom acts as the Lead Investor.</dd><dt><dfn>Current Ratio</dfn></dt><dd>Corresponds to the current ratio. It indicates the ratio of current assets to the current liabilities of a company. If the current ratio is less than 1, a part of current liabilities is not covered by the current assets, i.e. under certain circumstances assets must be sold to cover liabilities. Therefore, this liquidity ratio must always be greater than 1, whereby one should aim according to the so-called \"banker\'s rule\" (also known as Two-to-One-Rule) for a minimum value of 2.</dd><dt><dfn>Debt Ratio</dfn></dt><dd>The Debt Ratio is the proportion of debt to total capital and total assets analogous to the equity ratio of the equity.\r\nThis key figure indicates the ratio between debt and equity. The higher the debt, the higher the debt ratio.</dd><dt><dfn>Deferred Taxes</dfn></dt><dd>Hidden tax charges or benefits that have arisen due to differences in approach and / or the valuation of assets and liabilities between the tax accounts and the trade balance and are expected to reduce in subsequent years, i.e. to lead to differences in the future between tax and perform trade-balance-sheet profits. Deferred tax assets should reflect the future tax benefits (future tax higher income potential) future tax expense, deferred tax liabilities (future tax higher yield potential).</dd><dt><dfn>Dilution</dfn></dt><dd>When a company issues additional shares at a lower price in the context of a capital increase and the existing shareholders do not participate according to their current share, the shares of existing shareholders lose value, they are diluted.</dd><dt><dfn>Discounted-Cash-Flow Method</dfn></dt><dd>The possibility of determining the value of the company. Calculated on the basis of the discounted future Cash Flow over a certain period of time. The basis is the projected Free Cash Flow and a residual value that will be discounted to their present values.\r\nIn this method, the assets are allocated with an operational importance, namely the achievement of future income. The method assumes that the assets of the company generate a constant perpetuity of sustainable net profits. The capitalization of this income is calculated using the formula for eternal pensions of future earnings divided by the discount rate.</dd><dt><dfn>Early Stage (Financing)</dfn></dt><dd>Financing in the first phase of young, privately owned companies with equity. Usually, specialized companies (venture capital firms) offer the Early-Stage financing. These companies often offer other services besides the financing for start-up companies such as consulting activities and regular monitoring of the overall activity of the company. This funding is often associated with great risk, but offers large profit potential in the event of a subsequent success of the new company.</dd><dt><dfn>Earn-out</dfn></dt><dd>The portion of a company purchase price, which is conditional on the future success of the company. A key figure, usually the turnover, is defined for the compensation of the remaining company purchase price. A percentage of sales is determined to repay the purchase price.</dd><dt><dfn>EBIT</dfn></dt><dd>Earnings before interest and taxes.</dd><dt><dfn>EBIT Margin</dfn></dt><dd>A company\'s key figure that indicates the ratio of EBIT to sales as a percentage. It is particularly suitable for comparing the performance of different companies.</dd><dt><dfn>EBITDA</dfn></dt><dd>Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.</dd><dt><dfn>EBITDA Margin</dfn></dt><dd>The EBITDA margin is calculated from the ratio of the EBITDA to sales as a percentage. It is suitable for comparing the operating performance of different companies, regardless of their investment cycle.</dd><dt><dfn>Economic Value Added (EVA)</dfn></dt><dd>Key figure, which is used in a comprehensive performance measurement and value. The Economic Value-Added-Value approach calculates the residual income of the investment being valued. An investment will create value in accordance with this approach if it generates a positive \"spread\" (difference) between the actual return and the demanded cost of capital.</dd><dt><dfn>Employee stock options</dfn></dt><dd>Form of employee participation. The right to acquire shares or options on shares of your company at a discounted price after a specified waiting period.</dd><dt><dfn>Entity Method</dfn></dt><dd>A variant of the Discounted-Cash-Flow valuation method based on total capital, with which the gross value of the company is determined. First, a detailed Free Cash Flow is drawn up over a period of five to ten years. These gross quantities are then discounted with the WACC. In order to obtain the effective value of equity, the borrowed capital must be subtracted.</dd><dt><dfn>Equity</dfn></dt><dd>Equity</dd><dt><dfn>Equity Kicker</dfn></dt><dd>Equity Kicker means the possibility of sharing in the company\'s success. This may, for example, be in the conversion of Mezzanine Capital into equity, i.e. a \"real\" participation. Equity stakes are also conceivable for a desired future IPO. Outside investors are thus given the opportunity to purchase shares in partnerships or corporations at a later date, often at special rates.</dd><dt><dfn>Equity Ratio</dfn></dt><dd>The equity ratio indicates the proportion of economic equity to the adjusted total assets of a company. The higher the ratio, the lower the debt ratio.</dd><dt><dfn>Equity Story</dfn></dt><dd>Documentation as part of an emission process, in which the essential characteristics of the company and its planned corporate strategy are shown (the success of the company, in the past and in the future).</dd><dt><dfn>Equity-Method</dfn></dt><dd>A variant of the Discounted-Cash-Flow valuation method that directly determines the value of equity. First, a detailed planning of cash flow over a period of five to ten years. The interest and the growth rate of the debt are to be deducted from this. These net variables are then discounted with the cost of equity, which then gives the value of equity.</dd><dt><dfn>Excess profit method</dfn></dt><dd>A traditional method of business valuation, where the company\'s value is determined using the profits. Profit is meant to denote that which is attained over the normal return of the asset value.</dd><dt><dfn>Executive Summary</dfn></dt><dd>Summary of, for example, a business plan.</dd><dt><dfn>Exit</dfn></dt><dd>Withdrawal from a capital investment. Whoever makes capital available to start-up companies, shall sell off his interest after a certain time in the company that has meantime become established, because this no longer lies in his capital focus. A withdrawal may be via an IPO or a sale to another company. This process is known as an Exit Strategy, because the intention is to realize a profit from the investment made.</dd><dt><dfn>Expansion Financing</dfn></dt><dd>Growth and expansion financing. The company in question has reached the break-even point or makes a profit. The funds will be used to finance additional production capacity, product diversification and market expansion.</dd><dt><dfn>Fair Value</dfn></dt><dd>The fair value is used according to IAS and US GAAP as a generic term for all market-related valuations.

Free Cash Flow is the amount resulting from the overall consideration of the business. It is the only amount of money that is free to satisfy the requirements of investors.</dd><dt><dfn>Fundraising</dfn></dt><dd>Procurement of investment capital. The start-up phase of a Venture Capital fund (VC fund), in which drawing funds are obtained for institutional, industrial or private investors. Most VC companies put funds aside at irregular intervals where they collect the money that they then invest in other companies. The better the track record of a Venture Capital company, the greater their chances to collect money in the future.</dd><dt><dfn>Fusion</dfn></dt><dd>A Fusion is the equivalent of a merger of two or more companies into a whole new company. In reality, however, it is a so-called friendly takeover of one of the companies involved. The agreement on the word \"fusion\" should mitigate the sales character of the transaction to a third party. To the outside there should be no transferee and taken over company.</dd><dt><dfn>Going concern value</dfn></dt><dd>The asset components are valued at those values, which their current replacement cost would be at market prices (reproduction value of the company). Replacement values are calculated from the acquisition cost at current prices less depreciation (consumption value based on age).</dd><dt><dfn>Going Private</dfn></dt><dd>Repurchase of the stock of a company in private ownership.</dd><dt><dfn>Going Public</dfn></dt><dd>IPO of a company. See IPO.</dd><dt><dfn>Gross Margin</dfn></dt><dd>The gross margin indicates how much a company earned (as a percentage of sales) after deducting production costs. Other costs, e.g. for research and development, marketing and management, do not make up part of the value. The gross margin is therefore not to be equated with the operating result.</dd><dt><dfn>Gross value of the company</dfn></dt><dd>A company\'s value before the deduction of liabilities. The gross value of the company is open to all investors.</dd><dt><dfn>Hands Off</dfn></dt><dd>Hands Off is the term used for a passive support of a company that is being established. The influence on the Executive Board is limited to participation on the advisory board or the board of the company.</dd><dt><dfn>Incubator</dfn></dt><dd>Bodies or institutions that entrepreneurs support in the founding of companies. The founder generally has access to professional counselling, coaching qualification or support through the necessary infrastructure such as office space and communications technology. In addition, the access to networks is supported. Incubator centres are often linked to public institutions such as technology centres to support start-ups or Venture Capital companies or Business Angels.</dd><dt><dfn>Initial Public Offering (IPO)</dfn></dt><dd>The initial public offering of shares of a company.</dd><dt><dfn>Institutional Investors</dfn></dt><dd>Large institutions such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds or large corporations that invest in equity funds.</dd><dt><dfn>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</dfn></dt><dd>The IRR is the discount rate at which the present value (PV) of net cash flow (NCF), a project is equal to its initial investment. The discount rate at which the Net Present Value (NPV) of the project is equal to zero.</dd><dt><dfn>Investor Relations</dfn></dt><dd>Active management of relations with current and potential investors, analysts and financial media with the aim of fostering a binding to with these target groups to the shares of their own company.</dd><dt><dfn>Joint Venture</dfn></dt><dd>Cooperation agreement for the joint operations of a company, the capital to be introduced, the know-how to be supplied, etc.</dd><dt><dfn>Later Stage Financing</dfn></dt><dd>Financing of expansions, acquisitions, bridgings, etc. at established companies.</dd><dt><dfn>Lead Investor</dfn></dt><dd>In a syndicate of Venture Capital companies (VC companies), the investor with the largest share assumes both the organization of the financing and the Hands-on support.</dd><dt><dfn>Letter of Intent (LoI)</dfn></dt><dd>Written declaration in advance of a transaction in which the intention of the buyer and seller to complete the corporate sale is announced.</dd><dt><dfn>Leverage</dfn></dt><dd>Level of external debt of a company, usually expressed as the ratio of debt to equity.</dd><dt><dfn>Leveraged Buy-out (LBO)</dfn></dt><dd>Predominantly debt-financed corporate takeovers.</dd><dt><dfn>Liquidation Value</dfn></dt><dd>Denotes the (theoretical) amount that can still be achieved in the event of liquidation with the disposal of all business objects.</dd><dt><dfn>Listing</dfn></dt><dd>Listing a company on the stock exchange.</dd><dt><dfn>Lock-up Period</dfn></dt><dd>The Lock-up Period or waiting period means the period in which the shareholders agree not to sell any shares after the Going Public of its holdings. The Lock-up Period is controlled very differently in Europe.</dd><dt><dfn>Make or Buy</dfn></dt><dd>Deciding whether a product or a service is to be made (make) or bought (buy).</dd><dt><dfn>Management buy-in (MBI)</dfn></dt><dd>A Management buy-in is when a company is taken over by external management or the acquisition is forced by an investor using a foreign management. This comes about especially when an external management believes that the company is being badly managed and could be more efficient through better management. This is also the opportunity to take over a company in a succession planning.</dd><dt><dfn>Management Buy-out (MBO)</dfn></dt><dd>The purchase of a company or part of a company or a controlling interest thereon by the company\'s management. Often, such a buyout is done with the help of private equity investors and a large proportion is financed with borrowed capital (Leveraged Buy-out, LBO), because managers may not have the financial means themselves.</dd><dt><dfn>Market Capitalization</dfn></dt><dd>Market Capitalization expresses the market value of a corporation. It is calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of shares.</dd><dt><dfn>Market Value</dfn></dt><dd>The Market Value is the price achievable under normal conditions, without regard to unusual or personal circumstances.</dd><dt><dfn>Merger &amp; Acquisition</dfn></dt><dd>Merger (also Fusion) and Acquisition (also Takeover, Purchase).

For example, matching the data from a buyer (purchase price, location, interests, sector) with those of the seller (purchase price, location of the business, industry) - \"merged\". The aim of Merging is to determine any matches.</dd><dt><dfn>Mezzanine</dfn></dt><dd>Mezzanine capital or Mezzanine financing (derived from the architectural term in the sense of a mezzanine floor) is a collective term to describe types of financing, which in their legal and economic configurations is a hybrid between equity and debt. Thereby in the classic version, a company is supplied with economic or shareholders\' equity, without granting the investors voting rights or reasonable control of the residual interest as genuine partners.</dd><dt><dfn>Net asset value</dfn></dt><dd>The net asset value is the replacement value.

Subjects implicated are balance sheets, people and material resources, strategic positioning, legal and financial risks and environmental liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe due diligence has basically an informative role, it reduces the information asymmetry between buyers and sellers and provides the necessary information for a qualified decision. Based on the information provided, authorative parameters can be made plausible for the evaluation (evaluation function). If the buyer is not a natural person, but a company instead (represented by its decision makers), then the due diligence has an important accountability function, because the managers can document a careful, conscientious deal for its stakeholders (exculpation function).\r\n\r\nDifferent types of due diligence are distinguished between (e.g. pre due diligence, pre acquisition due diligence, post-completion due diligence, post acquisition due diligence), which differ depending on the time of implementation as well as the objective. Due diligence takes place in the usual sales process, if the parties have agreed in principle and the conditions are specified in a so-called \"Term Sheet\" and in a non-binding offer to purchase, and this is accepted by the seller. After due diligence has been carried out, this \"Term Sheet\" is the basis for the development of the sales contracts. Only when the deal is signed does it become legally binding.\r\n\r\nFor the implementation of DD, the seller or his advisors set up a data room, in which the necessary documents and information are available. The data room can be made available physically or virtually.\r\n<h2>Analytical focus of a due diligence inspection</h2>\r\nThe due diligence inspection covers the following areas:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Legal Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Tax Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Financial Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Market / Commercial / Strategic Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Environmental Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Insurance Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Technical Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>IT Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Human Resources Due Diligence</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs the above criteria suggests, this list can be extended or shortened. Usually the seller presents the buyer or his advisors with a (wish) list of documents to be examined to. For an efficient process, we recommend that both parties agree on a joint due diligence list (Index). The buyers can prepare themselves and the seller can inform the buyer early enough if certain desired documents do not exist (for example, only a few SMEs have a business plan drawn up for the next 5 years or a detailed market and competitive analysis).\r\n\r\nThe inspector summarises the results in a due diligence report. Quantifiable results are used to validate the sales price. Non-quantifiable results lead to the recording of specific guarantees in the purchase agreement.\r\n<h2>Success factors in the implementation of due diligence</h2>\r\nThose seeking an efficient and cost-minimising due diligence review, specify the analysis focus of the due diligence on the company to be audited (type, size), the deal structure (Asset vs. Deal. Share Deal) and the objectives of the client. It makes little sense to conduct a thorough tax due diligence if the company is taken over in the context of an asset deal.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Due Diligence','','publish','closed','closed','','due-diligence','','','2016-01-20 14:48:43','2016-01-20 14:48:43','',48,'http://localhost/startupbroker/?page_id=56',4,'page','',0),(57,1,'2015-12-18 14:16:30','2015-12-18 14:16:30','','Due Diligence','','inherit','closed','closed','','56-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 14:16:30','2015-12-18 14:16:30','',56,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/56-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(58,1,'2015-12-18 14:16:54','2015-12-18 14:16:54','<h1>Become self-employed</h1>\r\nA company can be set up quickly. Business cards can be printed easily and cheaply, and a website is also online in no time. The real challenge in independence is to be successful with your business concept for the long term. The fact that many young entrepreneurs fail in this challenge, demonstrates the following characteristics.\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Start-ups</dt><dd>11,000 new companies are founded in Europe every year. Approximately 95% of the new companies employ 1 to 4 employees.\r\n\r\n</dd><dt>Survival rate</dt><dd>Less than three of four companies survive the second year. After fives years every second company goes bankrupt. Statistics  also confirm that young companies are in particular danger of going bankrupt.\r\n\r\n</dd><dt>Insolvency</dt><dd>Many companies have become insolvent due to payment difficulties in 2011. \r\n\r\n</dd><dt>Sizes</dt><dd>88% of all companies in Europe are so called micro companies (up to 9 employees). 99.7% pay to the small to medium sized companies category (up to 249 employees). The small to medium sized companies also count as the pillars of the economy. 99.3% of all companies are small to medium sized businesses, approximately 2 Mio, of which 81% are categorised as micro companies.\r\n\r\n</dd><dt>Legal form</dt><dd>Barely half of all companies are sole proprietorships.\r\n\r\n</dd></dl>In addition to the risks and difficulties, there are also many opportunities for the self-employed: There are few entrepreneurs who complain about their status. Employees of large companies, however, are often unsatisfied. It may therefore be worthwhile to at least consider the option of your own company. But what do you need?\r\n\r\nHonest answers to the following questions provide a sound basis for your decision:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Why do I want to be self-employed?</li>\r\n	<li>What goals do I want to achieve through self-employment?</li>\r\n	<li>Do I have all the necessary skills to build a business and to establish it in the market?</li>\r\n	<li>Is my previous track record enough to create confidence among potential customers?</li>\r\n	<li>Do I have an amiable entrepreneurial personality?</li>\r\n	<li>Am I ready to implement my goals even against resistance?</li>\r\n	<li>Can I manage my available resources sensibly?</li>\r\n	<li>Can I keep my head in turbulent situations?</li>\r\n	<li>Can I motivate myself and deal confidently with setbacks?</li>\r\n	<li>What is my financial capacity?</li>\r\n	<li>What do important people in my life (partner, family, friends) think about my planned self-employment?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDo you therefore have to be born as a ready-made entrepreneur? Certain conditions must be fulfilled for a successful entrepreneurial activity. It is usually an advantage if you become self-employed in an area, in which you are already specialised. A certain degree of extroversion makes it easier to talk to people. Also an understanding of the personal environment, your own perseverance and the ability to deal with disappointments can facilitate the start into entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Become self-employed','','publish','closed','closed','','become-self-employed','','','2016-01-20 14:51:35','2016-01-20 14:51:35','',48,'http://localhost/startupbroker/?page_id=58',5,'page','',0),(59,1,'2015-12-18 14:16:54','2015-12-18 14:16:54','','Become self-employed','','inherit','closed','closed','','58-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 14:16:54','2015-12-18 14:16:54','',58,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/58-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(60,1,'2015-12-18 14:17:24','2015-12-18 14:17:24','<h1>Buy a company instead of founding a new one</h1>\r\nOf the 110,000 plus new businesses set up each year in Europe, only about half survive the first 5 years, the rest have disappeared from the market within a short time.

Studies show that the higher the means needed for a start-up, the greater the chance of survival - the more financial resources required, the more time is spent in preparation. These types of business are not established as often, but they survive more often.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the start-up companies, about 110,000 businesses in Europe are passed on or sold to a successor each year. This provides many opportunities for individuals who want to start their own.\r\n\r\nThe chances of success in corporate purchasing as opposed to starting up is better in many cases: The buyer of an existing company can assume that the owner of the company has chosen the right location and included the appropriate products in his portfolio, otherwise the company would have stopped operating long ago. To overcome the last hurdle - the excessive demands - the majority of business owners have at their disposal the new owner with advice and assistance.\r\n\r\nWhen a company is being set up, the use of financial resources is often underestimated, this is much less the case when buying. The demand for liquidity can be estimated much better. In addition, the buyer already achieves the first turnover on the day he takes over and he has the sales history from the past. The risk of overly optimistic revenue and profit margin forecast is significantly lowered.\r\n\r\nEven with a purchase there is still the entrepreneurial risk. Buying, however, is a promising alternative to starting up.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Buy a company instead of founding a new one','','publish','closed','closed','','buy-a-company-instead-of-founding-a-new-one','','','2016-01-20 14:52:40','2016-01-20 14:52:40','',48,'http://localhost/startupbroker/?page_id=60',6,'page','',0),(61,1,'2015-12-18 14:17:24','2015-12-18 14:17:24','','Buy a company instead of founding a new one','','inherit','closed','closed','','60-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 14:17:24','2015-12-18 14:17:24','',60,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/60-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(62,1,'2015-12-18 14:17:47','2015-12-18 14:17:47','<h1>Strategic Acquisitions – Merger &amp; Acquisition (M&amp;A) – SME</h1>\r\nMergers &amp; Acquisitions (M &amp; A) gives companies the opportunity to grow by organic growth and through acquisitions.

The purchase of a company may be difficult and it is important that you remain cool-headed.\r\n\r\nStart Up Broker LC offers many different companies, which might be suitable for you. Check whether a company suits your talents, your capacities and your lifestyle. However, please do not forget that the perfect company does not exist. First and foremost, you will be taking a big step: as a business owner, you are in charge.\r\n\r\nPlease take the time to work through the guideline and to answer the questions for yourself. This will help you to sort out your targets and your motivation, your financial and your personal starting point:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>A business owner is called a business owner because he/she does business!</li>\r\n	<li>Important questions to be considered and answered previous to the purchase\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Establish or purchase a company</li>\r\n	<li>What should you pay attention to when buying a company?</li>\r\n	<li>Why do you wish to buy a company?</li>\r\n	<li>What is your time frame to find the right company?</li>\r\n	<li>Are you willing to invest an important part of your financial funds into a company?</li>\r\n	<li>Are you sufficiently independent to take decisions by yourself?</li>\r\n	<li>Is your family supporting you as a business owner?</li>\r\n	<li>Are you open in your search or are you looking for a specific kind of company?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you have appropriate expectations?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you need security?</li>\r\n	<li>How do you define success?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>The purchase process</li>\r\n	<li>How does a broker help you?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you need a lawyer?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>A business owner is called a business owner because he/she does business</h2>\r\nTo buy a company is a major step and a challenge for which you have to overcome your fears and concerns. Almost 90% of the people, who purchase a company have never been the manager of a company before. A person who always wants to be on the safe side should never start their own business.\r\n\r\nWhen you start your search, you should consider that being a business owner is more than just a job. It means a change of lifestyle. Very often, such a change is considerable: normally you work longer hours, you have to make all decisions by yourself and you need to be willing to do all kinds of jobs. In other words: you are responsible for all kinds of work necessary for the success of a company and to keep it going. In reality, this means you have to wipe the floor or change a light bulb yourself.\r\n\r\nWhat are the reasons for a private person to become a business owner?\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Take your destiny in your hands</li>\r\n	<li>Proud of service or product</li>\r\n	<li>Flexibility</li>\r\n	<li>Financial opportunities</li>\r\n	<li>Recognition</li>\r\n	<li>Safety</li>\r\n	<li>Privacy</li>\r\n	<li>Status</li>\r\n	<li>Contact with clients and staff</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Important questions which should be considered and answered previous to the purchase of a company</h2>\r\n<h3>a) Establish or purchase a company?</h3>\r\nApproximately 50% of all cases of insolvency occur during the first four years after the foundation of a company. This alarming statistic shows that people often do not consider three important factors before they establish a company: bad location and/or poor quality of a product, insufficient financial reserves and, last but not least, they are overwhelmed by demands.\r\n\r\nWhen taking over an already existing business you can be sure that the location that the founder of the company had chosen is good and that the right products are in the portfolio, otherwise the company would not have existed for a long time. In order to manage the third point, being overwhelmed by the demands, it is advisable to accept the help of the former company owner.  Most business owners are willing to support the new owner on their way to a successful business independency.\r\n<h3>b) What you should pay attention to when purchasing a company?</h3>\r\nUnfortunately, the initial question of many potential buyers is the price of a company and only as a second thought they consider what can be earned from it.\r\n\r\nImportant is the question, how much capital you need in order to finance the purchase price. However, there is no point in considering a purchase of a company if the requested amount of funds is higher than what you are able to finance.\r\n\r\nBuy a company, which you find easy to identify with. Being a proud business owner is an essential ingredient for success. On the other hand, the firm shall generate sufficient earnings in order to guarantee the coverage of your cost of living as well as the financial costs.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, consider the potential of a company, which may still be conceiled. What can be improved to make the company more profitable? A saying goes: \"Don\'t buy a company that cannot  be improved!\"\r\n<h3>c) Why do you wish to buy a company?</h3>\r\nIf you are not really motivated to buy a company, let it be. You must be entirely committed to become a business owner and this includes the right motivation. Being a business owner still is the basis of the \"great American dream\", but this does not mean that it is everybody\'s dream.\r\n\r\nIf working in a large organisation does not satisfy you anymore, going to work everyday only means earning money to you or if you have a job without any perspectives, then being independent may be the right option for you.\r\n<h3>d) What time-frame do you have to find the suitable company?</h3>\r\nIf you consider purchasing a company in two years you should start to gather the necessary information already now. However, there is no point in starting to search the right company now. Each company you find today is ready to be sold immediately.\r\n<h3>e) Are you willing to invest the most important part of your capital into a new company?</h3>\r\nThe purchase of an own company is an important financial investment. If you are a person that does not want to run any risks, also from a financial point of view, you should reconsider your decision to purchase an own company.\r\n<h3>f) Are you sufficiently independent to take all your decisions by yourself?</h3>\r\nIf you run a small business, you have to take many decisions. You are the boss and you are responsible. All decisions are your decisions, whether they are wrong or right. You will take wrong decisions for which you must bear the consequences. Are you able to cope with such a situation and do you have the strength to continue after such a failure? If you are constantly concerned and will have sleepless nights, an own company may not be the ideal option for you.\r\n<h3>g) Is your family supporting you as a business owner?</h3>\r\nIf your family, especially your partner, does not entirely agree with your decision, you should reconsider becoming a business owner. It is mandatory that your partner supports you. He or she has to know that being the owner of a company is very time-consuming. On the other hand, being your own boss means very often that your working hours are more flexible and offers the possibility once in a while to enjoy a free afternoon with your family.\r\n<h3>h) Are you open in your search or are you looking for a specific kind of company?</h3>\r\nIf you consider buying a company, it is advisable to be open to any kind of opportunity. There are many different companies and you should not narrow down your choice. Watch out for a company that guarantees you the income that you need (or at least the opportunity to do so), a company that you are able to finance and, last but not least, a company which offers opportunities to be successful by working hard.\r\n<h3>i) Are your expectations appropriate?</h3>\r\nIt is important that you keep your feet on the ground when defining your expectations. Many owners have built up their business over many years, have invested time and energy and it often represents their entire fortune. Many sellers will be willing to support you financially for the purchase of the company, however, they will not give you any presents.\r\n<h3>j) Do you need security?</h3>\r\nIf you need security, being a business owner is not the right option for you. Even if you examine all books and documents, you can never be sure since such figures are from the past. A new owner always brings changes along, no matter how small such changes are.  Everyone has a different way of managing a company and times change fast. Consider a company under the aspect of its potential for improvement. Naturally, a company\'s past financial data is important, however it does not give any guarantee for the future. You are the guarantee!\r\n<h3>k) What is the secret of success?</h3>\r\nIt is essential that you have enough financial assets to buy the company of your dreams and to be able to make the necessary amendments. As the starting phase may be difficult, you should be in possession of sufficient financial reserves.\r\n\r\nHowever, being successful or not depends also on factors that you are able to influence in a significant way: Your willingness to work hard and long hours especially in the beginning. Successful business owners claim to be at the same time secretary, vendor, bookkeeper and manager. That is exactly the attitude that will lead you to success! Think of not only being a \"planer\" - think of being a \"doer\"!\r\n<h2>Purchase process</h2>\r\nHow does one buy a company? There is no right or wrong way to do it. The important thing is that you get answers to all your questions and that the information, which is necessary, is available in order to help you to make the right decisions.\r\n\r\nThe following illustrates the usual process:\r\n<h3>a) Gathering of essential facts and figures</h3>\r\nIn the beginning, get information on prices, conditions, earnings, revised earnings and the general situation. For all companies for sale Start Up Broker LC draws up a short company description in which you will find the most important information.\r\n<h3>b) Visit the company</h3>\r\nIn order to check whether you like the location and the visual appearance, go and visit the company as a client. It would be too early to have a discussion with the owner. If it is unusual or difficult to visit the company as a client, then arrange a meeting with the seller.\r\n<h3>c) Insist on answers to your questions</h3>\r\nIf you like the company you should start trying to get answers to your questions. For example: What is the cost for the rent? For how many more years does the tenancy agreement run? How high was the turnover during the last few years? Is the seller in possession of figures, which prove his statements? At that moment it is not yet necessary to examine in detail the seller\'s books. At a later stage, there will be enough time for such an examination by means of a due diligence. It is now first and foremost important to get the answers that will influence your decision whether to buy the company or not.\r\n\r\nWhat you should pay attention to:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How long does the company exist already?Normally, if a company has existed for a long period of time, this confirms that such company is profitable. It is not without reason that this firm has been on the market for many years. It shows that the owner had chosen the right location and the right product.</li>\r\n	<li>How long has the current owner been in charge?An essential criterion for your decision to buy is information about the current owner. As a rule, the longer a company was in possession of the same owner, the more successful a company is. Nobody keeps a company if one does not earn money on it.</li>\r\n	<li>For what reason is the owner selling the company?This is a very important question! The actual reason for the sale will influence the seller\'s flexibility regarding the purchase price and the conditions of payment. If an owner has taken over the firm only six month ago and claims to want to retire now, you should get skeptical. However, do not forget that business people often get tired of a branch after a certain period of time and start to look for a new challenge. The question of the reason for the selling is very important, therefore, you should insist on an answer.</li>\r\n	<li>Profit and Loss account of small and mid-sized companies. Like any private person, companies try to pay as few taxes as possible. Accordingly, many expenses in the books are private expenses of the owner. It is worthwhile to have a closer look at the various expenses (costs for vehicles, travel expenses, expenses for representational activities, etc.). For example, the trip to Southern France, was it really a business trip? The company car, does it serve only for business purposes? We will support you in order to get these questions answered.\r\n\r\nHowever, when doing such research, please do not forget that all and any figures relate to the past. There is no guarantee what the future will bring. What kind of policy for expenses will you implement when owning the businesses? To what turnover will your ideas and your hard work lead? The company\'s future is in your hands!</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>d) Evaluate the company</h3>\r\nMany sellers have a more or less clear opinion of the price at which they want to sell the company. Naturally, they determine the price according to their subjective assessment and personal needs.\r\n\r\nWe know the market of companies sales and, therefore, based on our experience, we are able to evaluate a company. The evaluation of a company is always based on the revised earnings, i.e. the money which you as the owner will get after deducting of the financing costs.\r\n\r\nDuring the evaluation, figures are never absolute, but a value of a company is based on several aspects. It is important that you conduct such a evaluation of a company. In your opinion, what is the value of the company? There are many methods to answer such question, from a scientific approach to rules of thumb. If you feel unsure about doing such valuation on you own, consider consulting a professional, however, if possible this should not be your tax consultant. In order to exclude conflicts of interest, we can only help you with the evaluation if the seller is not our client.\r\n<h3>e) Make an offer</h3>\r\nOnce your essential questions are answered and you are still interested in buying the company, you should try to reach an agreement on the purchasing price with the seller. Usually, this is done by a non-binding offer that depends on several conditions, for example such as the in-depth examination of the core figures of the company.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for such offer is to check whether the seller will accept your suggestion of a purchase price and the according payment conditions. Do not forget that your offer is only binding if the information you received is true and if all your conditions will be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, if you have not yet come to terms regarding the financial aspects with the seller, there is no use in consulting external advisors that will make cost-intense and time-consuming examinations.\r\n<h3>f) In-depth examination (Due Diligence)</h3>\r\nOnce you have come to terms with the seller, it is time to start an in-depth examination and solve the difficulties in crucial points.\r\n<h2>What support does Start Up Broker LC offer?</h2>\r\nStart Up Broker LC gives you advise in connection with the purchase and the sale of companies.  We are happy to accept your mandate for a selective search of a company, for an independent company evaluation or for support in price negotiations.\r\n\r\nIn order to exclude conflicts of interest we are only able to accept your order for advise if the seller is not our client.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in one of the companies listed in our database, please contact us. We will inform you in detail about our offers and, after signing a confidentiality agreement, you will receive an extensive documentation of the company. We will take care of the entire sales process, however, we represent the sellers interests.\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\nThe decision whether you should buy a company or not or the questions if you should start your own business anyway, has to be made by yourself. It is only up to you!\r\n\r\nIn the end it depends on you if you want to take the challenge to become a successful independent business owner. This is a step you have to take on your own. Nobody can take that decision away from you. Not your tax advisor, not your broker and not your friends. It is your duty!\r\n\r\nWe are happy to invite you to contact us by phone or by e-mail in order to arrange an initial meeting.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Buyer guideline','','publish','closed','closed','','buyer-guideline','','','2016-01-20 14:57:46','2016-01-20 14:57:46','',48,'http://localhost/startupbroker/?page_id=64',8,'page','',0),(65,1,'2015-12-18 14:18:13','2015-12-18 14:18:13','','Buyer guideline','','inherit','closed','closed','','64-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 14:18:13','2015-12-18 14:18:13','',64,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/64-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(66,1,'2015-12-18 14:19:56','2015-12-18 14:19:56','<h1>Buy a company in Switzerland</h1>\r\nStart Up Broker LC is the largest and most successful consultancy and brokerage company for small and medium-sized companies (SME) in Europe.

Take the time to read the following paragraphs containing excellent information about how you should best prepare yourself and what you have to expect. \r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Decision to sell a company</li>\r\n	<li>What is the value of my company?</li>\r\n	<li>How can I increase the value of my company?</li>\r\n	<li>Confidentiality and discretion</li>\r\n	<li>What kind of documents are necessary?</li>\r\n	<li>What buyers want to know</li>\r\n	<li>The sales process</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Decision to sell the company</h2>\r\nYour decision to sell a company may be based on different circumstances. Whatever the reason is, for example retirement, changes in your private life, business-related circumstances or the wish to change your lifestyle, make sure that you have considered all other options and that you have thoroughly thought about your decision.\r\n\r\nThe decision to sell your own company may take a long time. Most people find it difficult to separate themselves from a company in which they have invested a lot of time and enthusiasm. The firm represents an important emotional value. Therefore, reconsider carefully all financial, juridical and emotional consequences before you reach the final decision to put your company on the market, otherwise you may lose a lot of time and money.\r\n\r\nSelling a company causes not only advertising and advisory costs, but financial consequences may also ensue due to possible delays in the selling process or the lack of the owner\'s entire concentration on the business.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is important that you do make any \"experiments\" but that your approach is professional from the beginning and that you define your targets as detailed as possible. Once you have reached a final decision, the sales process should be carried out efficiently and at the best possible price.\r\n\r\nStart Up Broker LC is your best choice to take care of the sale of your business.\r\n<h2>What is the value of my company?</h2>\r\nTry to find out what the situation of your company on the market is. It is important to picture the value of your company from the viewpoint of a buyer in order to define a realistic price. Unfortunately, money cannot buy emotional value.\r\n\r\nIn a non-binding meeting, an advisor of Business Broker AG will help you get a clear picture about the sales price and the procedure of the sale. Start Up Broker LC has developed an evaluation system that is based on five different models. Each of these models work with a different starting point, which leads to a different company value. Then, we consolidate this information. Our experience helps us to evaluate a company value that corresponds to the effective sales price.\r\n\r\nVery often there are different opinions about a company\'s value. Inform yourself on how the price was determined. The better informed you are , the easier it will be to reach a decision. However, in the end, it is the market that determines the value of your company.\r\n<h2>How can I increase the value of my company?</h2>\r\nThis is the right time to embellish your company. Install a new company panel, change the floor carpet, recycle old and used material, and let the building be painted. Everything should look as perfect as possible. Do not assume that a new owner will take care of that or of the possibility to ask for a lower sales price instead.\r\n\r\nMake an in-depth analysis of your company. Do not forget important aspects that make your company attractive to a buyer, such as the value of client information, self-developed products and/or processes, well-maintained infrastructure, secret recipes, user-specific software programs or skilled staff. Such values are called immaterial goods. Unfortunately, most methods of price-evaluation do not take such values into consideration, but they still may be a factor that could increase your company value.\r\n<h2>Confidentiality and discretion</h2>\r\nConfidentiality and discretion are extremely important when selling a company. Information of a planned sale may always become public and running rumors may lead to the loss of important clients or staff. The damage may be enormous. Start Up Broker LC puts most emphasis on complete discretion during the entire procedure.\r\n\r\nWith our experience, we are in the position to promote your company in a professional way excluding the threat of a scenario as aforementioned will occur. All potential purchasers have to sign a confidentiality agreement before they will be provided with detailed information.\r\n<h2>What documents are necessary?</h2>\r\nPlease find the following checklist with documents necessary for the sale of a company:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Balance sheet and profit and loss account of the last three years</li>\r\n	<li>Tax declaration form of the company of the last three years</li>\r\n	<li>VAT declaration of the last three years</li>\r\n	<li>List of the fixed assets including a table of depreciations</li>\r\n	<li>Copy of the tenancy agreement</li>\r\n	<li>List of loans and creditors of the company (amount, due date, repayment plan and interest rate)</li>\r\n	<li>List of debtors of the company (amount and due date)</li>\r\n	<li>List of stock of merchandise separated by category including table of depreciations</li>\r\n	<li>List of pending legal disputes (if applicable)</li>\r\n	<li>List of external advisors (if applicable)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur advisors are happy to support you in organizing and drawing up the necessary documents.\r\n<h2>What buyers should know</h2>\r\nThis question may come a little bit early to you since you have not reached the final decision to sell your company. However, it will surely help you to make the right decision. It is not only important to know, who the buyer is, but also what he or she wants to know when buying your company. The following are a few possible questions that you might be asked:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>How much money do I need to buy your company?</li>\r\n	<li>How high is the annual growth?</li>\r\n	<li>What is special, unique, out of the ordinary about your company?</li>\r\n	<li>What are the characteristics of your products or services?</li>\r\n	<li>What possible developments exist for your company?</li>\r\n	<li>Who is your main competitor?</li>\r\n	<li>What are the risks?</li>\r\n	<li>What kind of additional advantages can the buyer generate?</li>\r\n	<li>What is the situation of revenue in bad or in good times?</li>\r\n	<li>How big is the stock of merchandise?</li>\r\n	<li>How high is the indebtedness?</li>\r\n	<li>Is it planned that the seller will stay in the business for a certain period of time in order to train the new owner?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>The sales process</h2>\r\nStart Up Broker LC will draw up an individual marketing plan for your company and implement the steps gradually. The buyers located with the help of that system will then be invited for a personal interview.  We will check their qualifications and present your company only to potential buyers. The next step will be to organize a site inspection of your company, which will happen in a very discreet way. We recommend you only answer technical questions, whereas your advisor will take care of questions related to company figures and the purchase price, which may already be subject to negotiation.\r\n\r\nIn case the potential buyer is still interested in your company, we will receive an offer for you. Usually, such an offer depends on one or several conditions, such as the buyer\'s request to examine your financial documents in detail, look into your tenancy agreement or other materially relevant details.\r\n\r\nWe will present you all offers that we receive for your company and, together, we will consider all the pros and cons. At first sight, you might not be satisfied with some points, some may not be according to your expectations but others may be very positive.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we recommend you to examine the offers thoroughly in order to be able to reach a substantiated decision. Either you reject an offer, you make a counter offer or you accept an offer.\r\n\r\nOnce you and the buyer have come to terms, we will ensure that the conditions are fulfilled as soon as possible. At this point, some buyers search advise of external advisors. It is very important that you cooperate in such a process, if not, the buyer may get the impression that you are hiding something from him/her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as all the conditions are fulfilled, the sales contract will be drawn up and signed. Once the contract is signed, the payment will be effectuated and the company handed over to the buyer.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/tabid/62/Default.aspx?ct=sell\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Seller guideline','','publish','closed','closed','','seller-guideline','','','2016-01-20 15:07:29','2016-01-20 15:07:29','',66,'http://localhost/startupbroker/?page_id=72',3,'page','',0),(73,1,'2015-12-18 14:21:02','2015-12-18 14:21:02','','Seller guideline','','inherit','closed','closed','','72-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 14:21:02','2015-12-18 14:21:02','',72,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/72-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(74,1,'2015-12-18 14:21:32','2015-12-18 14:21:32','<h2>Do you want to sell your company?</h2>\r\nUse the most successful European internet platform for company sale and decisively register your offer.

Conclusion</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>1. General information on company valuation</h3>\r\nOne must basically differentiate between the theoretical value of the company and the realizable value of the company: The theoretical value of the company can be determined using various methods, each method generates different values. Therefore, there is no right or wrong theoretical value of the company, but different values, which are varying plausible for different viewers.\r\n\r\nThe realizable value of the company can only be established for a non-listed company if the company is actually sold. It is always a snapshot.\r\n\r\nAn assessment can be divided roughly into two types of methods: the net asset value and the income value. With the intrinsic value method, the company value is made up from the rated capacity, minus the rated debt. Here the assets can be used at book value, replacement or liquidation value. Hidden reserves must be considered accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe evaluated value of a company, it is not enough to use only the intrinsic value. The tangible assets alone do not create value, if a corresponding income is not earned. It can sometimes also be the case that with very little tangible assets one can generate a high revenue. Therefore, a company’s earning power also plays an important role in the evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe income capitalization methods show what can be earned on the existing assets. The earning power does not include the value of intangible assets such as components of the customer base, market position and reputation. It is also determined by the company’s strategy, the market situation and the capabilities of the management.\r\n<h3>2. Reasons and occasions for a company valuation</h3>\r\nThe reasons for carrying out a business valuation are varied. In the context of a corporate sale or succession planning, the business valuation is essential for determining the price. The company valuation is also a very valuable tool for corporate governance in strategy definition and selecting alternatives. Company valuations continue to be required in legal cases as part of an expert report as well as in the establishing and distributing inheritances.\r\n<h4>2.1 Company Sale/Succession Plan</h4>\r\nAs the owner of your company decides on either a sale or succession planning, it is important to assess the site by way of a company valuation. When evaluating a company is clear what value the company has at the time of the valuation. The right arguments can be found during the price negotiation phase by means of the factors analysed. The company value is therefore the same as an argumentation value. Different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic) are taken into account during the valuation. The argumentation value shows that the calculated value is generally not equal to the eventual price to be paid. There are additional specific and subjective aspects of negotiation.\r\n<h4>2.2 Strategy definition</h4>\r\nBased on a company valuation and the resulting lessons learned, improvement measures can be established in respect of a subsequent sale of the company. Since the value drivers of the shareholder value are crystallized in a valuation, it is possible to use this to (re)align strategy. It makes sense, for example, to check the value proposition of the individual cost components. The use of personnel, premises and the tied up capital (such as machinery or vehicles) should be scrutiniz and checked rigorously for possible savings. On the revenue side it is critical if the generated revenue of a business unit also has a positive impact on the overall profitability of the company or if it pushes this down.\r\n<h4>2.3 Arbitration value</h4>\r\nWhen parties are in dispute, it may be necessary to determine the arbitration value of a company. As an example, the divorce process can be named here, where there will be a dispute over the amount of the developed assets in the form of the company value. Business Broker AG has experience in the preparation of court reports and takes on the corresponding orders.\r\n<h4>2.4 Inheritance</h4>\r\nWould you like to know what the value of your business is and what value you want to leave your descendants one day, then it is essential to determine a company\'s value, which is not only theoretically correct, but can also be achieved. We will help you determine a value that is not beyond the market and based on assumptions, one that has a meaningful relationship to reality.\r\n\r\nIf you have undergone the painful experience of having lost a family member who has built up a company over the years and you (possibly jointly with other heirs) are now faced with the issue of succession, it is imperative for the parties to use a comprehensible company valuation oriented to market prices as a decision basis.\r\n<h3>3. Company valuation methods</h3>\r\nThere are a variety of company valuation methods, which as described above are divided into two basic categories: intrinsic value method and discounted earnings method. In addition, there are market value methods (multipliers, multiples), which are used for the valuation and which with other methods can make the obtained results plausible. It analyses what has already been paid in past transactions (Transaction Multiples) or what will be paid on the stock exchange for market prices (Trading Multiples). Furthermore, there are corporate policies that are theoretically correct, but not relevant in practice for SMEs, since they are simply not appropriate enough or are of too little importance or not documented enough (e.g. the valuation using the real options theory). In practice it is customary to use a valuation mix of the relevant methods. The valuation mix applied may vary industry to industry, however, it is based on the experience and the expertise of completed projects.\r\n\r\nStart Up Broker LC has extensive practical know-how, which they can draw on in each individual project valuation.\r\n<h4>3.1 Entity vs. Equity Approach</h4>\r\nTwo different perspectives and approaches can be pursued with all company valuation methods.\r\n\r\nThe entity approach takes into account the sources of income accruing to the equity investors and lenders. In other words, it is valued from the perspective of the overall company (Enterprise Value, Entity) and the gross value of the company is ascertained. If you subtract the debt, you get the net value of the company, which equals the equity. When selling a business it is the net value of the company that is relevant. This can also be derived directly from the equity approach. Only the equity holders who are entitled to sources income are capitalized. The direct derivation of the corporate value using the equity method is done, for example, in the stock assessment.\r\n<h4>3.2 Intrinsic-value method</h4>\r\nWith the intrinsic value method, all existing assets are in the balance sheet, so the assets of the company are summarized. The intrinsic value is usually calculated on going concern values (so-called reproductive values). All assets together form the total of the company’s assets and referred to as the gross asset value. To work out the net asset value of the company, i.e. the intrinsic value of equity, the debt (all debt and liabilities of the company) is deducted from the gross asset value.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"342\" />\r\n<h5>3.2.1 Book value, hidden reserves and deferred taxes</h5>\r\nThe assets in the financial accounting (balance control) represent book values and need to be revised first. The difference between the book values and the actual values includes undisclosed reserves to which the book values should be adjusted. The deferred taxes on hidden reserves can be drawn in since a positive influence is achieved on the income statement or a higher income is reported in a future release of hidden reserves. The deferred taxes can be taken into account when calculating the net asset values, in which the valuation difference (between book values and market values) is multiplied by half the tax rate and subtracted from the calculated net asset value. The use of half the tax rate takes into account, on the one hand, the subsequent collection of the taxes in time (time value of money) and, on the other hand, the scheduling of when to release the hidden reserves (the tax burden will not turn out quite so high).\r\n<h5>3.2.2 Going concern value (reproduction or replacement cost)</h5>\r\nWith the intrinsic value for the going concern value, assets are considered to be the value that they cost at today’s replacement cost at market prices. The continuation value thus indicates how much the replacement cost would be to reproduce the company. The acquisition values at current prices are used, from which the depreciation (consumption value) is deducted on grounds of age, resulting in the replacement value.\r\n<h5>3.2.3 Liquidation Value</h5>\r\nThe liquidation value is the value of the assets that can be attained after deduction of liabilities and liquidation costs. It should be noted that in a liquidation due to the tight time frame and because of the possible orientation of the assets to the purpose and the specialisation of the company, it may result in lower prices.\r\n<h5>3.2.4 Non-operational assets</h5>\r\nWhen valuing a company using the intrinsic value method, the operational assets are summed up in the first place. The company may have, however, additional non-operational assets such as real estate, which are not related to the operational activities, or there is excess liquidity that is not needed for the operation (this is not usually the case for smaller companies). These non-operational assets are to be listed separately or added in addition to the net intrinsic value and shown separately.\r\n<h5>3.2.5 Conclusion for the intrinsic value method</h5>\r\nThe intrinsic value is an inventory of existing holdings (assets), i.e. the existing matter of a company. The net intrinsic value represents the effective value of the equity, i.e. the corrected tax values of assets of the hidden reserves, minus the debts or liabilities of the company. The intrinsic value can be seen as a lower limit in the valuation of a company because tangible assets at the valuation point are physically present.\r\n<h4>3.3 Earning value methods</h4>\r\nThe earning value methods evaluate a company based on the anticipated sources of income, which the company will generate for the company owners in the future with the existing substance. The future sources of income may be in profits or cash flows. The individual earning value methods can be distinguished depending on the type of revenue. So the widespread Discounted Cash Flow method, valid as an assessment standard, is based on a cash flow factor and the pure earning value methods and also the excess profit methods to a profit factor. So-called dividend models (e.g. dividend discounting or the dividend growth model) are based on expected revenue in the form of dividends that accrue to the shareholders in the future. The dividend models are not listed here, because these are relevant for the stock assessment and also for listed companies with a constant dividend.\r\n<h5>3.3.1 Basic principles of the Earning Value Calculation</h5>\r\n<strong>3.3.1.1 Time value of the money and consideration of risks</strong>\r\nEarning value methods are all based on the same methodology: Anticipate revenue that accrues to the company owners in the future will be adjusted to the time of evaluation. The basic argument for this is the time value of money. This means that a franc is worth more today than tomorrow, as the money today can be invested at a specified interest rate (risk free market interest rate). In addition to the time value of money, the risk is taken into account, with which the returns vary in the future, what is referred to as so-called volatility. The higher the volatility, the higher the risk and therefore the cost of capital with which the time delayed revenues are discounted, i.e. are transferred to the valuation date. The cost of capital is an interest rate that considers both the temporal component mentioned, as well as the revealed risk. Discounting specifically means that a future form of income (FS) is divided by the term (1 + interest rate)<sup>period (T)</sup> to obtain the present value of the income (present value). The revenue can be profits or cash flows, which accrue at the end of each fiscal year to the company owner.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"621\" height=\"77\" />\r\n<strong>3.3.1.2 Determining the cost of capital</strong>\r\nThe amount of the capital costs has a major impact on a company\'s value, since the expected forms of revenue will be compared when evaluating the cost of capital and discounted at the WACC. The cost of capital consists of both the rates of return of equity (cost of equity) and debt capital (borrowing costs). To calculate the cost of capital, the cost of equity is weighted with the equity and debt capital costs by the percentage of debt. With the cost of debt, corporate taxes are also taken into account because the interest expenses are tax deductible. Hence the term tax-adjusted (WACC - Weighted Average Cost of Capital) is used (see Section 3.3.2 Discounted cash flow method). Equity is the most expensive capital. The required rate of return of the equity investors is much higher than the borrowing rate. By borrowing funds (for example in the form of a bank loan), the total capital costs are reduced, thereby changing the financing structure (it is the so-called financial leverage effect).\r\n\r\nThe required rate of equity can be determined using the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model). Here a risk premium and, where appropriate, risk increases for the limited trade ability (for listed companies) and the size (at small and medium-sized, unlisted companies) are added to a rate perceived as being without risk (e.g. 10-year Swiss government bond). The risk premium is derived from the product of the equity beta ß<sub>EK</sub> and the market risk premium or market returns. The equity beta beta ß<sub>EK</sub> indicates how much the stock price fluctuates compared to the market. The empirical determination of the equity beta ß<sub>EK</sub>implies a stock market listing. Since each company has a different funding structure and capital structure, this must be taken into account when calculating the beta. This is done with the so-called Hamada\'s formula, which transforms the beta values ß<sub>GK</sub> of the Stock Exchange (this refers only to the business risk) into the ß<sub>EK</sub>, which in addition to financial risk even incorporate the company-specific financial risk. For unlisted companies, determining the cost of equity is more difficult because there are no empirical data on market beta derivation. In determining the betas, only the experience of past transactions, especially in the field of small and medium companies, plays a very important role. In addition, comparative values of publicly traded companies in the same industry can be used.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"546\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.2 Discounted Cash Flow Method</h5>\r\nThe discounted cash flow method (DCF) is, as the name suggests, a cash flow-based company valuation method. First, the costs incurred in the future, so-called free cash flows are derived or predicted, and then using the tax-adjusted average cost of capital WACC<sub>s</sub> discounted at the valuation date.\r\n\r\n<strong>3.3.2.1 Calculation of Free Cash Flows (FCF)</strong>\r\nFree cash flow estimates the cash flow from business operations, which, after investment in net operating working capital and fixed assets into the company\'s owners are, so to speak, freely available.\r\n\r\nFree Cash Flow at Entity Level is derived as follows:\r\n<p class=\"paraBorder\">EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes)\r\n- Taxes on EBIT\r\n= NOPAT (Net operating profit after taxes)\r\n+ Depreciation on intangible assets\r\n+ Amortisation of intangible assets\r\n- Changes in Net Working Capital\r\n- Capital Expenditures (Capex)\r\n- Changes in Goodwill\r\n<strong>= Unlevered Free Cash Flow</strong></p>\r\nThe DCF method according to the entity approach is considered as Best Practice, whereby the free cash flows are discounted to entity level with the tax-adjusted average cost of capital WACC<sub>s</sub>. The tax adjustment with the WACC is necessary because in the calculation of free cash flow, taxes are directly deducted from EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). This is theoretically incorrect because the borrowing costs are tax deductible and so taxes must not be subtracted directly from the EBIT, but from the EBT (earnings before taxes) - (disclosure of too high taxes). Since in practice it is difficult, however, to predict the exact applicable taxes, the \"incorrectness\" mentioned in the WACC<sub>s</sub> is taken into account, so when determining the cost of debt, the taxes are incorporated and so the taxes that have been estimated too high are corrected again.\r\n\r\nAn income statement plan is drawn up for the next 4-5 years, starting from a valuation point. A simplified scenario is worked with for the time periods after the 4-5 years. A so-called residual value is determined. Here, the assumption is made that the investment currently meets the depreciation, so that the free cash flow to be discounted on a straight agrees on the entity level with the NOPAT (Net Operating Profit after Taxes). The gross value of the company consists of the actuarial value of free cash flow at the Entity level together with the cash value of the residual value.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the net value of the company, the value of equity, the net debt is subtracted from the company\'s gross value.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"456\" />\r\n<strong>3.3.2.2 Residual value, planning horizon, eternal growth</strong>\r\nThe difficulty in defining the planning horizon is the weighting of the residual value. The greater the number of planning years, the more difficult it is to plan the future free cash flows, because the quantity of the residual value is smaller than the value of the company. It therefore makes sense to forecast only about 4-5 years, as these are justifiable and understandable, and therefore accept a higher proportion of the residual value at the company\'s value.\r\n\r\nIn the planning of future profits or free cash flows one can make the assumption that profits should have an eternal growth after the planning horizon. In the denominator of the DCF formula, the growth rate g is then subtracted from the WACC<sub>s</sub>. The assumption of perpetual growth NOPAT is a very strong statement and must be viewed with great caution and above all provided with a reasonable and founded justification.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.3 Pure earning value method</h5>\r\nAside from a detailed planning of the future years, one can perform a simplified earning value calculation. Here it is assumed that a perpetual profit (before interest payments) can be achieved and this profit corresponds as the equivalent to the free cash flow entity. This stems from the fact that there are no changes in working capital and that investments just meet the depreciation, which implies that only replacement investments will be made. The resulting profit is regarded as eternal and is hereby discounted with the non-tax adjusted WACC in this case, because the taxes in the calculation of EBIT (earnings before interest) are calculated correctly.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel07.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"208\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.4 Goodwill</h5>\r\nThe difference between the revenue value and the intrinsic value is called goodwill. Goodwill describes part of the purchase price, which is paid in addition to the value of the material elements of capital, for the customer base, reputation, brand, market position, access to the work performance of employees and for other intangible assets. The amount of goodwill sometimes depends on the industry sector. If a company sells a capital intensive business, the goodwill in relation to the sales price is considerably lower than in a pure service company, where there are tangible assets.\r\n<h5>3.3.5 Average value method (Mean value method)</h5>\r\nThe average method involves a weighted averaging of asset and revenue value.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel08.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"367\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.6 Excess profit methods</h5>\r\nThe intrinsic value method and the discounted cash flow method can be connected with each other using the excess profit process. Here recoverable excess profit is added to the gross asset value over a certain period T. The excess profit is the difference between the budgeted profit before tax (earnings before interest) and the normal profit, which is the product of asset value and the non-tax-adjusted cost of capital (WACC). The budgeted profit can be higher than normal profit, for example due to a strong market position, due to competitive advantages, but it is time limited. The excess profit adopted for a certain period is capitalised with the present value annuity factor, composed as in the following formula:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"484\" />\r\n<h4>3.4 Market Value Method (multipliers, multiples)</h4>\r\nThe corporate value can be determined with publicly listed companies by the prices paid on the stock exchange (trading multiples) or compared with the acquisitions, transaction prices (Transaction multiples) already paid for by the company. Trading multiples and transaction multiples are summarised under the term of market multiples (multipliers). Important Market multiples are revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, net profit multiple, the price-earnings ratio (PER or P/E ratio) or the Market-to-book ratio, where the multiples are always a multiple of the listed figures. With unlisted companies a comparison is made with prices paid on the stock market, however, proven to be relatively difficult. A comparison may be of use when establishing a price range.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"361\" />\r\nIn the multiple-evaluation it is important that it starts from the same base. Either one rates at the corporate level (enterprise value, gross, unlevered) or at the equity level (equity value, net, levered). It is also useful to form an average of the individual multiples, so as to balance a possible bias or offset. Moreover, it makes sense to form an average over several years for each included Multiple.\r\n<h4>3.5 Ownership profit (EBITDA)</h4>\r\nParticular attention is given to the important EBITDA Multiple. EBITDA stands for <i>Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation (fixed assets) and amortisation (on intangible assets)</i>. This represents an important tool in corporate valuation especially for small and medium-sized companies. This multiplier is from the financing structure and influenced by the state of the investment cycle and therefore one of the most meaningful multipliers. A company that has just invested finds itself confronted with higher depreciation and a lower profit than a company that has made no investments over time.\r\n\r\nThe owner of earnings based on the EBITDA represents the actual cash flow generated, adjusted to reflect corrections and before depreciation. If one adds the gross salary (including benefits) to the EBITDA that the owner of the company has paid out to himself, this results in the owner earnings (EBITDA level). Multiplied by a certain factor, this represents a fundamental price indicator in particular regarding the evaluation of the profitability of small and medium-sized companies, which a DCF valuation may not make much sense. The origin of the term: owner’s profit (EBITDA), owner’s cash flows come from the Anglo-American term. Usually the owners themselves are active in the company and will benefit from various services provided by the company for him. In relation to an employee he would have to finance for such benefits for himself from his work income.\r\n\r\nThe starting point for calculating the owner’s profit at EBITDA level is always the EBITDA according to the financial statements. To which the following adjustments or corrections are to be made:\r\n<div class=\"divBorder\">\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>EBITDA according to the financial statements</strong></li>\r\n	<li>Addition of the gross salary of the owner or owners (including bonuses, bonuses and benefits)</li>\r\n	<li>Addition of additional charges which are not included in the gross wage</li>\r\n	<li>One-off addition/subtraction, non-recurring expenses/revenues, which were debited/credited to the P&amp;L account</li>\r\n	<li>Addition/subtraction income/expenses not operationally required, which were debited/credited to the P&amp;L account</li>\r\n	<li>Addition/subtraction of income/expenses of a private nature, which were billed to the business</li>\r\n	<li>Addition/Subtraction formation/release of hidden reserves</li>\r\n	<li>Addition of easily and quickly realisable savings</li>\r\n	<li><strong>= owner’s profit at EBITDA level</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\nWith over 100 sales of companies in the past four years, Start Up Broker LC has built up a very valuable database in terms of multiples, which are actually paid in the area of small and medium sized companies. Of course, this requires a prior revision of the financial statements as listed above.\r\n<h3>4. Procedure during a company valuation</h3>\r\nTo perform a meaningful due diligence, regardless of the method chosen, some key steps are to be considered:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Revision of the financial statements</li>\r\n	<li>Business valuation with a method mix</li>\r\n	<li>Comparison and interpretation of results</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>4.1 The revision of financial statements</h4>\r\nThe balance sheets and income statements for the past 3 years must be revised for non-operating, and extraordinary personal income and expenses or assets and liabilities. Examples of this can also include rented business premises, which are shown as an expense in the P&amp;L account, but are not required for the business activities. Or the owner runs an expensive car and pays for its leasing costs through the business. These additional expenditures are to be neutralized or taken out.\r\n<h4>4.2 Company valuation Method mix</h4>\r\nThe presentation and selection of assessment methods always gives rise to discussions. First, it should be noted that a company valuation method is limited to its own explanatory power. In our experience, the mix of company valuation methods has proven successful. The intrinsic value can be regarded as a lower limit in the definition of a bandwidth value. Thereafter, the earning value is determined using the discounted cash flow method and is weighted and combined together with the earning value discussed by multiples, which is already a temporal and methodological average, according to the average value method (this is often the mean value method). So we combine the discounted cash flow method with our extensive knowledge from existing transactions (Transaction multiples).\r\n<h4>4.3 Comparison and interpretation of the results</h4>\r\n<h5>4.3.1 Plausibility check</h5>\r\nThe plausibility of the valuation results can be done with technically simple valuation methods, like the pure income capitalisation method is. This makes sense particularly with the discounted cash flow method, in which the cost of capital, the planning figures and the residual value represent particularly value-sensitive factors, this makes sense. Furthermore, plausibility checks can be made with multiples. Crucial to the plausibility test, however, is the experience of the consultant from other projects. An experienced consultant can use his knowledge of the existing company valuations that come from different industries and are characterised by a variety of company-specific traits, for profit. He has developed over time a practical and goal-oriented perspective and is able to assess very carefully whether it makes sense to determine company value and apply a mix of methods or not.\r\n\r\nWith a company valuation, assumptions are made regarding the sales development and also the development of costs (staff costs, material costs, other operating expenses). In addition, with the earning value method, a certain cost of capital is set and used for discounting the flow of revenue. As the future is uncertain, it makes sense to work with different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic), especially with regard to the sales of a company, which may depend in particular on the industry or market development, and with respect to different levels of capital cost percentages (company-specific risks). With the change in the cost of capital, it is easy to see how sensitively the earning value reacts.\r\n<h5>4.3.2 Traceability</h5>\r\nIt is essential that the assumptions are critically analysed, especially with the earning value methods (specially the DCF method). One deals intensively with the company\'s business model and value factors, which responds sensitively to an assessment. It is not done with a purely technical valuation on the basis of a business plan or planning figures (plan P&amp;L statements, projected balance sheets, schedule of cash flows). The assumptions must be readily comprehensible, so that an outsider sees and also understands the most important value driver on the valuation of a business.\r\n<h3>5. Conclusion</h3>\r\nThe company valuation is not about finding the absolutely correct value. Company values do not represent pure objective values, instead they are based on many subjective assumptions. The point is to determine a value bandwidth, which can be used for plausibility and communication purposes. The bandwidth value of the earning value comes from the fact that different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic) and various other assumptions are made. The income/cost development is evaluated and so are the business and financial risks of the company and the industry development of different variants. A lower limit is determined based on the intrinsic value that is physically present and which varies depending on the capital intensity of operations. Depending on the scenario, then the return value and the goodwill to be attained are specified as the difference between the earning and net asset value. All the results obtained in the context of a company valuation require expert assessment and a plausibility check. Only those who can see the value driving factors and an assessment of the underlying assumptions in detail, will be in a position to interpret the calculated value of the company.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div class=\"callToAction_button\"><a class=\"callToAction_buttonText\" href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></div>\r\n<span class=\"callToAction_text\">Ask for our no-obligation information pack:</span>','Valuation methods','','publish','closed','closed','','valuation-methods','','','2016-01-20 15:16:36','2016-01-20 15:16:36','',76,'http://localhost/startupbroker/?page_id=80',2,'page','',0),(81,1,'2015-12-18 14:22:51','2015-12-18 14:22:51','','Valuation methods','','inherit','closed','closed','','80-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 14:22:51','2015-12-18 14:22:51','',80,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/80-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(82,1,'2015-12-18 14:23:35','2015-12-18 14:23:35','<h1>Succession Advice</h1>\r\n<strong>Start Up Broker LC has already supported more than 300 successions.

In order to achieve this goal, we have created a transparent market which makes it easier for buyers and sellers to find each other and where the sale of the business can be processed in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect. Based on our expertise, we offer the parties a helping hand and guide them through the challenging process with many pitfalls along the way.\r\n\r\nWith great commitment and dedication, our customers have created significant value: They have set up a company and created many jobs. Customers, suppliers and employees rely on the existence of the company as a going concern. A large part of the assets is tied up in the company and can only be realized by selling the business. We are in the same boat and have the same goals as our customers. Thanks to a large number of potential buyers, we offer our customers the opportunity to select and implement the option which works best for them.\r\n\r\nThe benefit for the economy is enormous. It has helped to save over 1,000 jobs, and our customers have received well over CHF 350 million thanks to successful sale of companies.\r\n\r\nCompanies are works of art, and we are committed to conserving them.','Mission','','inherit','closed','closed','','11-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 14:49:33','2015-12-18 14:49:33','',11,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/11-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(107,1,'2015-12-18 14:50:25','2015-12-18 14:50:25','<h1>Buying and selling companies successfully</h1>\r\n<h2>Business Broker – Best Practice Guide</h2>\r\n<table class=\"content_text\" border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/BBBookCover.jpg\" alt=\"Business Broker Buch: Unternehmen erfolgreich kaufen und verkaufen\" border=\"0\" /></td>\r\n<td>Book bound, 238 pages, Language German, 2012\r\nOrell Füssli Verlag\r\n\r\nCHF 59.- including VAT\r\n(+ Shipping costs)\r\n<div class=\"callToAction_button\"><a class=\"callToAction_buttonText\" href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/tabid/62/Default.aspx?ct=book\">Order</a></div></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table class=\"content_text\" border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Authors:</td>\r\n<td>Andreas Schubert, Reto Meli, Richard Jauch, Fabian Rudin, Jérôme Andermatt (longstanding employee at Business Broker AG)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Contents:</td>\r\n<td>Every year 5000 small and medium companies are sold in Switzerland.

The reader receives templates of all the documents and checklists. The book helps to avoid expensive, often disastrous errors. Through this the sale of the own business becomes the crowning achievement of a business person’s career and not, as is so often the case, the start of a legal dispute.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p align=\"left\"></p>','The Book','','inherit','closed','closed','','13-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 14:50:25','2015-12-18 14:50:25','',13,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/13-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(108,1,'2015-12-18 14:52:01','2015-12-18 14:52:01','<h1>Our Teams</h1>\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Team</dt> <dd><a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/en/about-us/team-switzerland\" data-rit-tabid=\"149\">Switzerland</a></dd></dl>&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Team</dt> <dd><a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/en/about-us/team-germany\" data-rit-tabid=\"150\">Germany</a></dd></dl>','Team','','inherit','closed','closed','','15-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 14:52:01','2015-12-18 14:52:01','',15,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/15-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(109,1,'2015-12-18 14:52:41','2015-12-18 14:52:41','<h1>Career</h1>\r\nA career with Business Broker AG offers the opportunity to work in an interesting and inspiring environment while taking up lots of responsibility. We want to enjoy working and we want to make progress. We have high demands but your efforts will be rewarded.\r\n\r\nWe work independently and believe that only if we surpass our internal and external client\'s expectations they will be fully satisfied. This is our promise and it should be yours as well.\r\n\r\nIn our working culture, we are success-oriented and, at the same time, we put emphasis on good cooperation. Important factors are a fair and respectful approach and a direct, open and honest communication within the team as well as towards our clients.\r\n\r\nWe have a very flat hierarchy. It is not the position that counts, but the argument and, in the end, the success. If you are looking for responsibility, you will get the opportunity to transform your ideas and visions. Once you have proved that you are successful, we will discuss together what kind of further steps you can take in your career.\r\n\r\nIt is not important to know everything right from the start; however, you must be willing to learn and to make progress. Changes and responsibility offer many chances - do you want to take them?\r\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\r\nAccording to your personal background and to your interests we will offer you several possibilities. Different perspectives are fruitful. Therefore, we are not looking for staff with a specific professional education, but for people with different professional and personal experiences.\r\n\r\nWhat we expect:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Completed higher education</li>\r\n	<li>Several years of successful professional activity</li>\r\n	<li>Interest for economical relations</li>\r\n	<li>Business- as well as client-oriented thinking and acting</li>\r\n	<li>Capacity to work independently and success-oriented</li>\r\n	<li>High degree of self-motivation, in order to be able to cope with difficulties</li>\r\n	<li>Capacity not only to listen carefully, but also to draw the right conclusions and to initiate its carrying out</li>\r\n	<li>Willing to go the extra mile for your clients</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Please send your complete application to</dt><dd><a href=\"mailto:karriere@businessbroker.ch\">karriere@businessbroker.ch</a></dd></dl>','Career','','inherit','closed','closed','','18-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 14:52:41','2015-12-18 14:52:41','',18,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/18-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(110,1,'2015-12-18 14:56:23','2015-12-18 14:56:23','<h1>Our Locations</h1>\r\n<article>\r\n<h2>Switzerland</h2>\r\n<div><dl class=\"callToAction\"><dd><a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/en/about-us/location-zurich\" data-rit-tabid=\"135\">Zurich</a></dd></dl><dl class=\"callToAction\"><dd><a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/en/about-us/location-gossau-st-gallen\" data-rit-tabid=\"147\">Gossau St. Gallen</a></dd></dl><dl class=\"callToAction\"><dd><a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/en/about-us/location-lausanne\" data-rit-tabid=\"136\">Lausanne</a></dd></dl></div>\r\n<div><img id=\"Map\" src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Location/map-ch.gif\" alt=\"Business Broker AG Map\" usemap=\"#map_ch\" border=\"0\" /><map name=\"map_ch\"></map></div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/en/about-us/location-zurich\" data-rit-tabid=\"135\">Zurich</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/en/about-us/location-gossau-st-gallen\" data-rit-tabid=\"147\">Gossau St. Gallen</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/en/about-us/location-lausanne\" data-rit-tabid=\"136\">Lausanne</a>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</article><article>\r\n<h2>Germany</h2>\r\n<div><dl class=\"callToAction\"><dd><a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/en/about-us/location-frankfurt-am-main\" data-rit-tabid=\"138\">Frankfurt am Main</a></dd></dl></div>\r\n<div><img id=\"Map\" src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Location/map-de.gif\" alt=\"Business Broker AG Map\" usemap=\"#map_de\" border=\"0\" /><map name=\"map_de\"></map></div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/en/about-us/location-frankfurt-am-main\" data-rit-tabid=\"138\">Frankfurt am Main</a>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</article>','Locations','','inherit','closed','closed','','20-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 14:56:23','2015-12-18 14:56:23','',20,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/20-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(111,1,'2015-12-18 14:57:12','2015-12-18 14:57:12','<h1>Testemonials</h1>\r\n<h2>This is what company owners say who have sold their business with the help of Business Broker AG</h2>\r\n<blockquote>I would like to thank you for the good times with you. It was fireworks through all the negotiations and discussions, thanks to you both I have come through everything so well.  The great result was awesome.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mrs. Graber, ex flower shop \"le clou\", Zurich</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>At first, I was sceptical as I believe that I am myself a good salesman and do not need help. I also found it expensive. Preparing company presentations by using the figures from the annual report was very interesting. After I had given you the mandate I found the total support and the quick sale very agreeable. Now, after the sale, I have to say that I have been very satisfied with your work. Thanks again.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mr. P. Gutenberg, ex Bakrona Zurich AG</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Thank you very much for your help and your big effort. Of course I will recommend Business Broker AG whenever I can.  It is still difficult to say but I am looking forward to the next cooperation, you never know.\r\n\r\n<cite>Ercole Fusco, ex Fusco Plumbing GmbH</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Working together with Business Broker AG was always a pleasure. The reception was very courteous, the execution of the work professional and quick. What I appreciated were the clear understandings which Mr. Schubert repeated after each meeting, so that everyone knew exactly what was meant. The strategies for the sale of my company were supported by a tightly led web portal, the presentation of which shows many years\' experience and is set up in a contemporary manner. Discretion was always a top priority; every interested party was bound to observe confidentiality. During the negotiations Mr. Schubert had the necessary calmness, which almost everyone in the position of selling their company is lacking. Also, a high level of know how is a very important factor which Business Broker AG have. I can therefore only recommend engaging the services of Business Broker AG when selling companies and for succession planning.\r\nI am convinced that success is not only achieved through ideas, strategies, goal settings and figures, it requires a human being who is also emotionally involved. Emotional decisions are the strength which is in us and which needs to be considered just as much as intelligence. From my point of view I have been able to experience this combination from Business Broker AG. It also touched me, that when I collected my documents after the sale, the team came together to congratulate me on my success. I felt happy after each visit; it also had something glorious about it because I was one step closer to my success. I would like to thank everyone for the exciting and wonderful time.\r\n\r\n<cite>Markus Anderegg, ex AM Caretaker</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>I wish you much success with selling. It is clear for me that you are the best and that I will recommend you anytime.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mrs. F. Fader, ex Move Fitness enter</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>What remains is to thank you for the steadfast commitment and for the excellent efforts to date.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mr. V. Niederberger, ex Londonhouse</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>No matter how it will develop, we have to thank you very much. We have been independent for almost two decades and we have experienced quite a lot. Your efficiency, paired with understanding and friendliness, is unique.\r\nContinue to work like this. We will make it up to you by referring as many as possible independent company owners wanting to sell to you. I hope that at least in this way we can stay in touch.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mr. Hoehler, Buyer Gallery Joy AG, Zurich</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Firstly: Compliments for the home page, compliments for your efficient way of working, compliments for the excellent documentation.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mr. R.W., interested party, Fitness Centre Move, Zurich</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Thank you very much for the prompt delivery of the documents regarding the company. How someone works says a lot about a person and his character. With all of you I have a good feeling to have\" landed\" at the right place.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mr. D.P. interested buyer, Event Agency</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Dear Mr. Schaufelberger. I have seen the programme on Cash TV and after visiting your website I would like to congratulate you on this idea. As you know, first impressions count and remain. Should I have a company to sell, or would want to by one, I will come and see you. Best regards and much success!\r\n\r\n<cite>Mrs. M.V.Z.</cite></blockquote>\r\n<h2>This is what company owners have to say that have placed an advertisement with Business Broker AG</h2>\r\n<blockquote>I have had my company on your website for a while and I am well looked after und advised by your team.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mrs. M.H. owner fashion boutique</cite></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Hi, I have had my hairdressing salon advertised with Business Broker for about a month and I am totally enthusiastic. Over 20 interested parties have responded and soon I will decide for one of them. If I ever had to sell again, then only through Business Broker. Respect!\r\n\r\n<cite>Mr. L.T. owner hair dressing salon</cite></blockquote>','Testimonials','','inherit','closed','closed','','22-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 14:57:12','2015-12-18 14:57:12','',22,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/22-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(112,1,'2015-12-18 14:57:57','2015-12-18 14:57:57','<h1>References</h1>\r\nThe following transactions have been concluded with the participation of members of our team giving advisory services in an operative or strategic way:\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Impressions</dt> <dd><a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Referenzen/Bildergalerie/tabid/140/Default.aspx\">Picture Gallery</a></dd></dl>\r\n<h2>Sale</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>E.S.

In contrast to this is the Share Deal.</dd><dt><dfn>Asset Stripping</dfn></dt><dd>Sale of assets or sub-areas of an acquired company immediately after its acquisition. Typical motives are either the financing of the purchase price or the opportunity that the total value can be raised through the sale of individual parts. However, the tax consequences should be taken into account.</dd><dt><dfn>Assets</dfn></dt><dd>A company\'s Assets are the sum of all factors of production required by the company in cash, all their rights (e.g. patents, licenses) and material resources (e.g. raw materials, machinery, buildings, land). A distinction must be made between fixed assets and current assets.</dd><dt><dfn>Assets ratio 1</dfn></dt><dd>Provides information about how high the equity is in the ratio of fixed assets.</dd><dt><dfn>Assets ratio 2</dfn></dt><dd>Provides information about how high the equity is plus the long-term debt in the ratio of fixed assets.</dd><dt><dfn>Averaging Method</dfn></dt><dd>The term Averaging Method covers several methods of business valuation. Here, the yield value and the intrinsic value of a company are recorded. The determination of the value of the company is carried out in different ways with a different but fixed weighting of the values in the averaging. In Switzerland, the profitability is used twice and the asset value is used once to calculate the value of the company. The Stuttgart-based method uses the profitability once and the asset value twice for the calculation. The Berlin-based methods both values weighted equally</dd><dt><dfn>Benchmark</dfn></dt><dd>Benchmarking refers to the comparison of the performance of one’s own company with that of other companies. The performance counter of the other company is known as a Benchmark.

The method assumes that the assets of the company generate a constant perpetuity of sustainable net profits. The capitalization of this income is calculated using the formula for eternal pensions of future earnings divided by the discount rate.</dd><dt><dfn>Early Stage (Financing)</dfn></dt><dd>Financing in the first phase of young, privately owned companies with equity.

Furthermore, in future Business Broker AG may provide information that contains statements about future developments. Due to their nature, statements about future developments contain general and specific risks and uncertainties. There is a risk that predictions, forecasts, projections and results, which are described or implied in the future-oriented statements, will not be accurate.\r\n\r\nPast changes in value are not an indication, and offer no guarantee, of future changes in value. No explicit or implicit liability or guarantee is assumed in relation to future changes in value. Investments are associated with risks, including the potential loss of the capital used. The price, value and earnings of securities or companies can fall as well as rise. Specific securities or companies are subject to large variations and may suddenly lose their value to a considerable extent. Under some circumstances, some of them may not be capable of being realised immediately, which means that the sale or liquidation of these investments may prove to be difficult. Difficulties may also emerge in obtaining reliable information about the value of the investment or the risks to which the investment is exposed. Investments in smaller companies, investments focused on a single industry, country or region, and/or which anticipate the use of third-party capital, are associated with special risks. The investor alone bears the risks of such investments.\r\n\r\nThe information and opinions contained on this website, other than those relating to third-party advertisements or advertising material, derive from sources we consider reliable or from our customers and their advisers; however Business Broker AG guarantees neither the accuracy nor the completeness of the information and opinions.

Our user notice also applies. For customers who have signed a fee agreement, if there is a contradiction between the general terms and conditions of business and the fee agreement, the fee agreement applies.\r\n<h2>How an order is formed / Ready to print / Publication / Notification duties</h2>\r\nThe advertisement order occurs when the advertisement arrives in electronic form at Business Broker AG. This should be in “ready-to-print” form and is sent by the advertiser electronically when the order is placed (advertisement job).\r\n\r\nBusiness Broker AG reserves the right to request changes in content before or during publication or to refuse publication without providing information about the reasons, to suspend publication or to delete or alter data from advertisers that does not satisfy the requirements. The advertiser will be informed by Business Broker AG if the content is changed; the advertiser can either accept the changes or the advertisement will be deleted. Business Broker AG expressly points out that advertisements with a sales price over 150,000 would normally not be published.\r\n\r\nContent that violates the law or infringes the rights of third parties shall not be accepted; also such as is not based on a specific offer, but only refers to the client’s offering in another place. The client is obligated to immediately inform Business Broker AG when the advertisement is no longer available or up-to-date. Business Broker shall then immediately remove the advertisement from the website.\r\n<h2>Advertiser responsibility / Legal notice / Advertiser responsibility</h2>\r\nBusiness Broker AG is not obligated to check the information and documents received from the client for the accuracy and completeness of their content. Rather, Business Broker AG is entitled to assume that the contents of the information and instructions are accurate and complete, as well as materially binding. Consequently, Business Broker AG assumes no responsibility for their content. The client is obligated to adhere to the appropriate legal provisions, directives and association rules of the industry. The client assumes responsibility for, and assures Business Broker AG, that the data, advertisements and advertising content it supplies is truthful, up-to-date, thorough and in conformity with the law and that it does not infringe the rights of third parties (e.g. copyrights) or constitute a criminal offence.\r\n\r\nIf Business Broker AG detects improper use, or is notified of unlawful content by an external body, Business Broker AG reserves the right, either before or during publication, to request changes in the content or to immediately reject, suspend or delete the content.\r\n\r\nThe client indemnifies Business Broker AG, as well as its agencies and assistants, against all claims that may be brought by third parties in connection with the data supplied by the client. If action is brought against Business Broker AG in the courts, the client is obligated, after third-party notification has taken place, to join the proceedings. In any case the client is obligated to assume all court and out-of-court costs incurred in connection with the claims of third parties. This also includes reimbursing the costs of any required legal representation.\r\n<h2>No guarantee – no liability</h2>\r\nThe liability of Business Broker AG is limited to intent and gross negligence. Liability for indirect and consequential damage is excluded. Furthermore, Business Broker AG excludes any guarantee that access to this website shall proceed without interruptions or errors, that faults will be remedied or that no viruses or other harmful components will be transferred when accessing the website. Business Broker AG rejects, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws and/or regulations, any express, legal or implied guarantee in relation to this website, and to all results that emerge from the use of this website and its contents, namely all guarantees with regards to the customary nature, non-infringement, suitability for a specific purpose or use, as well as any guarantees derived on the basis of applicable laws and/or regulations based on business and/or commercial practices or those derived from their equivalent. Furthermore, Business Broker AG assumes no guarantee or liability in relation to the accuracy, timeliness, suitability, completeness or availability of this website or the information or results emerging from the use of this website. Under no circumstances, and on the basis of no applicable laws and/or regulations, does Business Broker AG assume liability for damages arising from non-contractual, contractual, fault-free or any other type of liability, or access or use of, or access that was obstructed to, this website or from actions or prohibitions resulting therefrom, regardless of whether the damage is direct, indirect, or incidental, consequential or indirect, of whatever type it is, including damages resulting from lost profits or demands and claims of third parties, even if Business Broker AG had the possibility to know, or had grounds to know, of such damages, demands and claims.\r\n<h2>Contractual duration / Prices / Invoicing / Payment terms / Cancellation</h2>\r\nContracts are normally concluded for a specific duration. The duration of the contract and the price are in line with the applicable provisions at the time the order is issued, which are published on the website at the time the order is issued and include VAT, unless otherwise agreed.\r\n\r\nThe right to alter prices or the duration of the advertisement running time is reserved. These may be decided by Business Broker AG at any time and do not require any special form of notification. They enter into force for all advertisers at the same time. The changes can also be applied to orders underway. The advertiser, however, has the right to withdraw from the contract within two weeks of the new prices being introduced, insofar as they have been applied to its contract. In this case settlement will be made pro rata temporis. Payments are due immediately once the order is transmitted. If payment does not arrive in a timely fashion, Business Broker AG reserves the right to dissolve the contract without notice or compensation.\r\n<h2>Data protection</h2>\r\nBusiness Broker AG commits itself to observe the data protection regulations, but cannot comprehensively guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of personal data. The right to reveal such data to official bodies when obligated to do so is reserved, e.g. when there is a suspicion of criminal acts.\r\n\r\nThe data and content supplied by the advertiser to Business Broker AG will be saved and processed by Business Broker AG for the purpose of fulfilling the contract. The advertiser authorises Business Broker AG to integrate the advertisement into the website, including through contractual partners, or to otherwise publish or process the data for this purpose. Business Broker AG assures the advertiser that its personal data (name, address, telephone number, email address) will not be sold or passed on to third parties. However, the advertiser explicitly grants Business Broker AG the right that it may be contacted by Business Broker AG in order to provide information about services or offers of Business Broker AG or that it may be sent brochures or other informational and advertising material by Business Broker AG. Furthermore, the advertiser recognises that the data may also be accessible in countries that do not have legal regulations comparable to those of Switzerland.\r\n<h2>Exclusive distribution and rights</h2>\r\nThe advertiser agrees that the advertisement shall not be freely available to third parties. It shall prohibit, in particular, the advertisements being taken over by third parties and transfers the right to Business Broker AG, using suitable means, to prohibit the use and processing of this advertisement in whatever form. All rights to programs, services, procedures, design, software, technologies, brands, companies, inventions and all materials in any way connected with Business Broker AG, lie with Business Broker AG. The advertisers alone are entitled to the rights to the texts supplied by them (e.g. brand rights, copyrights, name rights, etc.).\r\n<h2>Applicable law and place of jurisdiction</h2>\r\nThe place of jurisdiction is Zürich. Swiss law shall apply exclusively, in particular the Swiss Law of Obligations. Business Broker AG may also bring suits against advertisers where their registered office or place of residence is.','General terms and conditions of business','','inherit','closed','closed','','36-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 15:02:36','2015-12-18 15:02:36','',36,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/36-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(119,1,'2015-12-18 15:03:40','2015-12-18 15:03:40','<h1>Sale of companies</h1>\r\n<strong>Business Broker AG is the largest and most successful placement agency for small and medium sized companies (KMU).

We do not only determine and interpret the theoretical value of a company according to the various recognised methods, but we are also skilled in making very concrete transactions based on realisable price recommendations.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe valuation of a company is an extremely challenging task. The basis for any professional review is the revision of the figures in order to submit a satisfactory plan for future years and the meaningful application of the various recognised methods for corporate valuations. Each method provides different values – a valuation is of little use without a professional interpretation of individual results and the knowledge of realised projects.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for a company valuation are numerous. Business Broker AG prepares company valuations in the context of:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Succession Planning</li>\r\n	<li>Corporate sales</li>\r\n	<li>Strategy Definition</li>\r\n	<li>Court reports</li>\r\n	<li>Separations</li>\r\n	<li>Provision / distribution of an inheritance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you do not just want to know what your business is worth in theory, but also what price can be achieved in the market, then do not hesitate to contact us.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Request our unbinding info package at</dt><dd><a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/tabid/62/Default.aspx?ct=val\">Contact us</a></dd></dl>','Company valuation','','inherit','closed','closed','','42-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 15:04:47','2015-12-18 15:04:47','',42,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/42-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(122,1,'2015-12-18 15:05:28','2015-12-18 15:05:28','<h1>Succession Advice</h1>\r\n<strong>Business Broker AG has already supported more than 300 successions.

Subjects implicated are balance sheets, people and material resources, strategic positioning, legal and financial risks and environmental liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe due diligence has basically an informative role, it reduces the information asymmetry between buyers and sellers and provides the necessary information for a qualified decision. Based on the information provided, authorative parameters can be made plausible for the evaluation (evaluation function). If the buyer is not a natural person, but a company instead (represented by its decision makers), then the due diligence has an important accountability function, because the managers can document a careful, conscientious deal for its stakeholders (exculpation function).\r\n\r\nDifferent types of due diligence are distinguished between (e.g. pre due diligence, pre acquisition due diligence, post-completion due diligence, post acquisition due diligence), which differ depending on the time of implementation as well as the objective. Due diligence takes place in the usual sales process, if the parties have agreed in principle and the conditions are specified in a so-called \"Term Sheet\" and in a non-binding offer to purchase, and this is accepted by the seller. After due diligence has been carried out, this \"Term Sheet\" is the basis for the development of the sales contracts. Only when the deal is signed does it become legally binding.\r\n\r\nFor the implementation of DD, the seller or his advisors set up a data room, in which the necessary documents and information are available. The data room can be made available physically or virtually.\r\n<h2>Analytical focus of a due diligence inspection</h2>\r\nThe due diligence inspection covers the following areas:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Legal Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Tax Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Financial Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Market / Commercial / Strategic Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Environmental Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Insurance Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Technical Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>IT Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Human Resources Due Diligence</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs the above criteria suggests, this list can be extended or shortened. Usually the seller presents the buyer or his advisors with a (wish) list of documents to be examined to. For an efficient process, we recommend that both parties agree on a joint due diligence list (Index). The buyers can prepare themselves and the seller can inform the buyer early enough if certain desired documents do not exist (for example, only a few SMEs have a business plan drawn up for the next 5 years or a detailed market and competitive analysis).\r\n\r\nThe inspector summarises the results in a due diligence report. Quantifiable results are used to validate the sales price. Non-quantifiable results lead to the recording of specific guarantees in the purchase agreement.\r\n<h2>Success factors in the implementation of due diligence</h2>\r\nThose seeking an efficient and cost-minimising due diligence review, specify the analysis focus of the due diligence on the company to be audited (type, size), the deal structure (Asset vs. Deal. Share Deal) and the objectives of the client. It makes little sense to conduct a thorough tax due diligence if the company is taken over in the context of an asset deal.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/tabid/62/Default.aspx?ct=buy\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Due Diligence','','inherit','closed','closed','','56-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 16:01:12','2015-12-18 16:01:12','',56,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/56-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(128,1,'2015-12-18 16:01:57','2015-12-18 16:01:57','<h1>Become self-employed</h1>\r\nA company can be set up quickly. Business cards can be printed easily and cheaply, and a website is also online in no time. The real challenge in independence is to be successful with your business concept for the long term. The fact that many young entrepreneurs fail in this challenge, demonstrates the following characteristics.\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Start-ups</dt><dd>11,000 new companies are founded in Switzerland every year. Approximately 95% of the new companies employ 1 to 4 employees.\r\n\r\n</dd><dt>Survival rate</dt><dd>Less than three of four companies survive the second year. After fives years every second company goes bankrupt. Statistics from Germany also confirm that young companies are in particular danger of going bankrupt.\r\n\r\n</dd><dt>Insolvency</dt><dd>In Switzerland around 4.400 companies have become insolvent due to payment difficulties in 2011. Losses in the region of 3 to 4,7 billion francs arise annually as a result of insolvencies. 30.099 company insolvencies were counted in Germany in the past year.\r\n\r\n</dd><dt>Sizes</dt><dd>88% of all companies in Switzerland are so called micro companies (up to 9 employees). 99.7% pay to the small to medium sized companies category (up to 249 employees). In Germany the small to medium sized companies also count as the pillars of the economy. 99.3% of all companies are small to medium sized businesses, approximately 2 Mio, of which 81% are categorised as micro companies.\r\n\r\n</dd><dt>Legal form</dt><dd>Barely half of all companies are sole proprietorships.\r\n\r\n</dd></dl>In addition to the risks and difficulties, there are also many opportunities for the self-employed: There are few entrepreneurs who complain about their status. Employees of large companies, however, are often unsatisfied. It may therefore be worthwhile to at least consider the option of your own company. But what do you need?\r\n\r\nHonest answers to the following questions provide a sound basis for your decision:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Why do I want to be self-employed?</li>\r\n	<li>What goals do I want to achieve through self-employment?</li>\r\n	<li>Do I have all the necessary skills to build a business and to establish it in the market?</li>\r\n	<li>Is my previous track record enough to create confidence among potential customers?</li>\r\n	<li>Do I have an amiable entrepreneurial personality?</li>\r\n	<li>Am I ready to implement my goals even against resistance?</li>\r\n	<li>Can I manage my available resources sensibly?</li>\r\n	<li>Can I keep my head in turbulent situations?</li>\r\n	<li>Can I motivate myself and deal confidently with setbacks?</li>\r\n	<li>What is my financial capacity?</li>\r\n	<li>What do important people in my life (partner, family, friends) think about my planned self-employment?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDo you therefore have to be born as a ready-made entrepreneur? Certain conditions must be fulfilled for a successful entrepreneurial activity. It is usually an advantage if you become self-employed in an area, in which you are already specialised. A certain degree of extroversion makes it easier to talk to people. Also an understanding of the personal environment, your own perseverance and the ability to deal with disappointments can facilitate the start into entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/tabid/62/Default.aspx?ct=buy\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Become self-employed','','inherit','closed','closed','','58-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 16:01:57','2015-12-18 16:01:57','',58,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/58-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(129,1,'2015-12-18 16:02:45','2015-12-18 16:02:45','<h1>Buy a company instead of founding a new one</h1>\r\nOf the 11,000 plus new businesses set up each year in Switzerland, only about half survive the first 5 years, the rest have disappeared from the market within a short time. We are in an environment in which the survival rate for young companies is obviously overestimated. This shocking statistic is based on three factors that new entrepreneurs are often overlooked: Poor location and / or poor product, insufficient capitalisation and excessive demands.\r\n\r\nAnyone starting a business, usually prepares meticulously at the start and creates a detailed business plan – one would assume. Studies show that the higher the means needed for a start-up, the greater the chance of survival - the more financial resources required, the more time is spent in preparation. These types of business are not established as often, but they survive more often.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the start-up companies, about 11,000 businesses in Switzerland are passed on or sold to a successor each year. This provides many opportunities for individuals who want to start their own.\r\n\r\nThe chances of success in corporate purchasing as opposed to starting up is better in many cases: The buyer of an existing company can assume that the owner of the company has chosen the right location and included the appropriate products in his portfolio, otherwise the company would have stopped operating long ago. To overcome the last hurdle - the excessive demands - the majority of business owners have at their disposal the new owner with advice and assistance.\r\n\r\nWhen a company is being set up, the use of financial resources is often underestimated, this is much less the case when buying. The demand for liquidity can be estimated much better. In addition, the buyer already achieves the first turnover on the day he takes over and he has the sales history from the past. The risk of overly optimistic revenue and profit margin forecast is significantly lowered.\r\n\r\nEven with a purchase there is still the entrepreneurial risk. Buying, however, is a promising alternative to starting up.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/tabid/62/Default.aspx?ct=buy\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Buy a company instead of founding a new one','','inherit','closed','closed','','60-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 16:02:45','2015-12-18 16:02:45','',60,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/60-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(130,1,'2015-12-18 16:03:53','2015-12-18 16:03:53','<h1>Strategic Acquisitions – Merger &amp; Acquisition (M&amp;A) – SME</h1>\r\nMergers &amp; Acquisitions (M &amp; A) gives companies the opportunity to grow by organic growth and through acquisitions.

However, smaller companies are still only using this opportunity to a limited degree.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of growth through acquisition lie in the fact that growth targets are implemented geographically and/or sector-oriented quicker and more efficient and can thus support the defined growth strategy.

The purchase of a company may be difficult and it is important that you remain cool-headed.\r\n\r\nBusiness Broker AG offers many different companies, which might be suitable for you. Check whether a company suits your talents, your capacities and your lifestyle. However, please do not forget that the perfect company does not exist. First and foremost, you will be taking a big step: as a business owner, you are in charge.\r\n\r\nPlease take the time to work through the guideline and to answer the questions for yourself. This will help you to sort out your targets and your motivation, your financial and your personal starting point:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>A business owner is called a business owner because he/she does business!</li>\r\n	<li>Important questions to be considered and answered previous to the purchase\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Establish or purchase a company</li>\r\n	<li>What should you pay attention to when buying a company?</li>\r\n	<li>Why do you wish to buy a company?</li>\r\n	<li>What is your time frame to find the right company?</li>\r\n	<li>Are you willing to invest an important part of your financial funds into a company?</li>\r\n	<li>Are you sufficiently independent to take decisions by yourself?</li>\r\n	<li>Is your family supporting you as a business owner?</li>\r\n	<li>Are you open in your search or are you looking for a specific kind of company?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you have appropriate expectations?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you need security?</li>\r\n	<li>How do you define success?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>The purchase process</li>\r\n	<li>How does a broker help you?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you need a lawyer?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>A business owner is called a business owner because he/she does business</h2>\r\nTo buy a company is a major step and a challenge for which you have to overcome your fears and concerns. Almost 90% of the people, who purchase a company have never been the manager of a company before. A person who always wants to be on the safe side should never start their own business.\r\n\r\nWhen you start your search, you should consider that being a business owner is more than just a job. It means a change of lifestyle. Very often, such a change is considerable: normally you work longer hours, you have to make all decisions by yourself and you need to be willing to do all kinds of jobs. In other words: you are responsible for all kinds of work necessary for the success of a company and to keep it going. In reality, this means you have to wipe the floor or change a light bulb yourself.\r\n\r\nWhat are the reasons for a private person to become a business owner?\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Take your destiny in your hands</li>\r\n	<li>Proud of service or product</li>\r\n	<li>Flexibility</li>\r\n	<li>Financial opportunities</li>\r\n	<li>Recognition</li>\r\n	<li>Safety</li>\r\n	<li>Privacy</li>\r\n	<li>Status</li>\r\n	<li>Contact with clients and staff</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Important questions which should be considered and answered previous to the purchase of a company</h2>\r\n<h3>a) Establish or purchase a company?</h3>\r\nApproximately 50% of all cases of insolvency occur during the first four years after the foundation of a company. This alarming statistic shows that people often do not consider three important factors before they establish a company: bad location and/or poor quality of a product, insufficient financial reserves and, last but not least, they are overwhelmed by demands.\r\n\r\nWhen taking over an already existing business you can be sure that the location that the founder of the company had chosen is good and that the right products are in the portfolio, otherwise the company would not have existed for a long time. In order to manage the third point, being overwhelmed by the demands, it is advisable to accept the help of the former company owner.  Most business owners are willing to support the new owner on their way to a successful business independency.\r\n<h3>b) What you should pay attention to when purchasing a company?</h3>\r\nUnfortunately, the initial question of many potential buyers is the price of a company and only as a second thought they consider what can be earned from it.\r\n\r\nImportant is the question, how much capital you need in order to finance the purchase price. However, there is no point in considering a purchase of a company if the requested amount of funds is higher than what you are able to finance.\r\n\r\nBuy a company, which you find easy to identify with. Being a proud business owner is an essential ingredient for success. On the other hand, the firm shall generate sufficient earnings in order to guarantee the coverage of your cost of living as well as the financial costs.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, consider the potential of a company, which may still be conceiled. What can be improved to make the company more profitable? A saying goes: \"Don\'t buy a company that cannot  be improved!\"\r\n<h3>c) Why do you wish to buy a company?</h3>\r\nIf you are not really motivated to buy a company, let it be. You must be entirely committed to become a business owner and this includes the right motivation. Being a business owner still is the basis of the \"great American dream\", but this does not mean that it is everybody\'s dream.\r\n\r\nIf working in a large organisation does not satisfy you anymore, going to work everyday only means earning money to you or if you have a job without any perspectives, then being independent may be the right option for you.\r\n<h3>d) What time-frame do you have to find the suitable company?</h3>\r\nIf you consider purchasing a company in two years you should start to gather the necessary information already now. However, there is no point in starting to search the right company now. Each company you find today is ready to be sold immediately.\r\n<h3>e) Are you willing to invest the most important part of your capital into a new company?</h3>\r\nThe purchase of an own company is an important financial investment. If you are a person that does not want to run any risks, also from a financial point of view, you should reconsider your decision to purchase an own company.\r\n<h3>f) Are you sufficiently independent to take all your decisions by yourself?</h3>\r\nIf you run a small business, you have to take many decisions. You are the boss and you are responsible. All decisions are your decisions, whether they are wrong or right. You will take wrong decisions for which you must bear the consequences. Are you able to cope with such a situation and do you have the strength to continue after such a failure? If you are constantly concerned and will have sleepless nights, an own company may not be the ideal option for you.\r\n<h3>g) Is your family supporting you as a business owner?</h3>\r\nIf your family, especially your partner, does not entirely agree with your decision, you should reconsider becoming a business owner. It is mandatory that your partner supports you. He or she has to know that being the owner of a company is very time-consuming. On the other hand, being your own boss means very often that your working hours are more flexible and offers the possibility once in a while to enjoy a free afternoon with your family.\r\n<h3>h) Are you open in your search or are you looking for a specific kind of company?</h3>\r\nIf you consider buying a company, it is advisable to be open to any kind of opportunity. There are many different companies and you should not narrow down your choice. Watch out for a company that guarantees you the income that you need (or at least the opportunity to do so), a company that you are able to finance and, last but not least, a company which offers opportunities to be successful by working hard.\r\n<h3>i) Are your expectations appropriate?</h3>\r\nIt is important that you keep your feet on the ground when defining your expectations. Many owners have built up their business over many years, have invested time and energy and it often represents their entire fortune. Many sellers will be willing to support you financially for the purchase of the company, however, they will not give you any presents.\r\n<h3>j) Do you need security?</h3>\r\nIf you need security, being a business owner is not the right option for you. Even if you examine all books and documents, you can never be sure since such figures are from the past. A new owner always brings changes along, no matter how small such changes are.  Everyone has a different way of managing a company and times change fast. Consider a company under the aspect of its potential for improvement. Naturally, a company\'s past financial data is important, however it does not give any guarantee for the future. You are the guarantee!\r\n<h3>k) What is the secret of success?</h3>\r\nIt is essential that you have enough financial assets to buy the company of your dreams and to be able to make the necessary amendments. As the starting phase may be difficult, you should be in possession of sufficient financial reserves.\r\n\r\nHowever, being successful or not depends also on factors that you are able to influence in a significant way: Your willingness to work hard and long hours especially in the beginning. Successful business owners claim to be at the same time secretary, vendor, bookkeeper and manager. That is exactly the attitude that will lead you to success! Think of not only being a \"planer\" - think of being a \"doer\"!\r\n<h2>Purchase process</h2>\r\nHow does one buy a company? There is no right or wrong way to do it. The important thing is that you get answers to all your questions and that the information, which is necessary, is available in order to help you to make the right decisions.\r\n\r\nThe following illustrates the usual process:\r\n<h3>a) Gathering of essential facts and figures</h3>\r\nIn the beginning, get information on prices, conditions, earnings, revised earnings and the general situation. For all companies for sale Business Broker AG draws up a short company description in which you will find the most important information.\r\n<h3>b) Visit the company</h3>\r\nIn order to check whether you like the location and the visual appearance, go and visit the company as a client. It would be too early to have a discussion with the owner. If it is unusual or difficult to visit the company as a client, then arrange a meeting with the seller.\r\n<h3>c) Insist on answers to your questions</h3>\r\nIf you like the company you should start trying to get answers to your questions. For example: What is the cost for the rent? For how many more years does the tenancy agreement run? How high was the turnover during the last few years? Is the seller in possession of figures, which prove his statements? At that moment it is not yet necessary to examine in detail the seller\'s books. At a later stage, there will be enough time for such an examination by means of a due diligence. It is now first and foremost important to get the answers that will influence your decision whether to buy the company or not.\r\n\r\nWhat you should pay attention to:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How long does the company exist already?\r\n\r\nNormally, if a company has existed for a long period of time, this confirms that such company is profitable. It is not without reason that this firm has been on the market for many years. It shows that the owner had chosen the right location and the right product.</li>\r\n	<li>How long has the current owner been in charge?\r\n\r\nAn essential criterion for your decision to buy is information about the current owner. As a rule, the longer a company was in possession of the same owner, the more successful a company is. Nobody keeps a company if one does not earn money on it.</li>\r\n	<li>For what reason is the owner selling the company?\r\n\r\nThis is a very important question! The actual reason for the sale will influence the seller\'s flexibility regarding the purchase price and the conditions of payment. If an owner has taken over the firm only six month ago and claims to want to retire now, you should get sceptical. However, do not forget that business people often get tired of a branch after a certain period of time and start to look for a new challenge. The question of the reason for the selling is very important, therefore, you should insist on an answer.</li>\r\n	<li>Profit and Loss account of small and mid-sized companies\r\n\r\nLike any private person, companies try to pay as few taxes as possible. Accordingly, many expenses in the books are private expenses of the owner. It is worthwhile to have a closer look at the various expenses (costs for vehicles, travel expenses, expenses for representational activities, etc.). For example, the trip to Southern France, was it really a business trip? The company car, does it serve only for business purposes? We will support you in order to get these questions answered.\r\n\r\nHowever, when doing such research, please do not forget that all and any figures relate to the past. There is no guarantee what the future will bring. What kind of policy for expenses will you implement when owning the businesses? To what turnover will your ideas and your hard work lead? The company\'s future is in your hands!</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>d) Evaluate the company</h3>\r\nMany sellers have a more or less clear opinion of the price at which they want to sell the company. Naturally, they determine the price according to their subjective assessment and personal needs.\r\n\r\nWe know the market of companies sales and, therefore, based on our experience, we are able to evaluate a company. The evaluation of a company is always based on the revised earnings, i.e. the money which you as the owner will get after deducting of the financing costs.\r\n\r\nDuring the evaluation, figures are never absolute, but a value of a company is based on several aspects. It is important that you conduct such a evaluation of a company. In your opinion, what is the value of the company? There are many methods to answer such question, from a scientific approach to rules of thumb. If you feel unsure about doing such valuation on you own, consider consulting a professional, however, if possible this should not be your tax consultant. In order to exclude conflicts of interest, we can only help you with the evaluation if the seller is not our client.\r\n<h3>e) Make an offer</h3>\r\nOnce your essential questions are answered and you are still interested in buying the company, you should try to reach an agreement on the purchasing price with the seller. Usually, this is done by a non-binding offer that depends on several conditions, for example such as the in-depth examination of the core figures of the company.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for such offer is to check whether the seller will accept your suggestion of a purchase price and the according payment conditions. Do not forget that your offer is only binding if the information you received is true and if all your conditions will be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, if you have not yet come to terms regarding the financial aspects with the seller, there is no use in consulting external advisors that will make cost-intense and time-consuming examinations.\r\n<h3>f) In-depth examination (Due Diligence)</h3>\r\nOnce you have come to terms with the seller, it is time to start an in-depth examination and solve the difficulties in crucial points.\r\n<h2>What support does Business Broker AG offer?</h2>\r\nBusiness Broker AG gives you advise in connection with the purchase and the sale of companies.  We are happy to accept your mandate for a selective search of a company, for an independent company evaluation or for support in price negotiations.\r\n\r\nIn order to exclude conflicts of interest we are only able to accept your order for advise if the seller is not our client.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in one of the companies listed in our database, please contact us. We will inform you in detail about our offers and, after signing a confidentiality agreement, you will receive an extensive documentation of the company. We will take care of the entire sales process, however, we represent the sellers interests.\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\nThe decision whether you should buy a company or not or the questions if you should start your own business anyway, has to be made by yourself.

Take the time to read the following paragraphs containing excellent information about how you should best prepare yourself and what you have to expect. The book „Unternehmen erfolgreich kaufen und verkaufen“ of Business Broker AG published in 2012 delivers extensive information.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Decision to sell a company</li>\r\n	<li>What is the value of my company?</li>\r\n	<li>How can I increase the value of my company?</li>\r\n	<li>Confidentiality and discretion</li>\r\n	<li>What kind of documents are necessary?</li>\r\n	<li>What buyers want to know</li>\r\n	<li>The sales process</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Decision to sell the company</h2>\r\nYour decision to sell a company may be based on different circumstances. Whatever the reason is, for example retirement, changes in your private life, business-related circumstances or the wish to change your lifestyle, make sure that you have considered all other options and that you have thoroughly thought about your decision.\r\n\r\nThe decision to sell your own company may take a long time. Most people find it difficult to separate themselves from a company in which they have invested a lot of time and enthusiasm. The firm represents an important emotional value. Therefore, reconsider carefully all financial, juridical and emotional consequences before you reach the final decision to put your company on the market, otherwise you may lose a lot of time and money.\r\n\r\nSelling a company causes not only advertising and advisory costs, but financial consequences may also ensue due to possible delays in the selling process or the lack of the owner\'s entire concentration on the business.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is important that you do make any \"experiments\" but that your approach is professional from the beginning and that you define your targets as detailed as possible. Once you have reached a final decision, the sales process should be carried out efficiently and at the best possible price.\r\n\r\nBusiness Broker AG is your best choice to take care of the sale of your business.\r\n<h2>What is the value of my company?</h2>\r\nTry to find out what the situation of your company on the market is. It is important to picture the value of your company from the viewpoint of a buyer in order to define a realistic price. Unfortunately, money cannot buy emotional value.\r\n\r\nIn a non-binding meeting, an advisor of Business Broker AG will help you get a clear picture about the sales price and the procedure of the sale. Business Broker AG has developed an evaluation system that is based on five different models. Each of these models work with a different starting point, which leads to a different company value. Then, we consolidate this information. Our experience helps us to evaluate a company value that corresponds to the effective sales price.\r\n\r\nVery often there are different opinions about a company\'s value. Inform yourself on how the price was determined. The better informed you are , the easier it will be to reach a decision. However, in the end, it is the market that determines the value of your company.\r\n<h2>How can I increase the value of my company?</h2>\r\nThis is the right time to embellish your company. Install a new company panel, change the floor carpet, recycle old and used material, and let the building be painted. Everything should look as perfect as possible. Do not assume that a new owner will take care of that or of the possibility to ask for a lower sales price instead.\r\n\r\nMake an in-depth analysis of your company. Do not forget important aspects that make your company attractive to a buyer, such as the value of client information, self-developed products and/or processes, well-maintained infrastructure, secret recipes, user-specific software programs or skilled staff. Such values are called immaterial goods. Unfortunately, most methods of price-evaluation do not take such values into consideration, but they still may be a factor that could increase your company value.\r\n<h2>Confidentiality and discretion</h2>\r\nConfidentiality and discretion are extremely important when selling a company. Information of a planned sale may always become public and running rumours may lead to the loss of important clients or staff. The damage may be enormous. Business Broker AG puts most emphasis on complete discretion during the entire procedure.\r\n\r\nWith our experience, we are in the position to promote your company in a professional way excluding the threat of a scenario as aforementioned will occur. All potential purchasers have to sign a confidentiality agreement before they will be provided with detailed information.\r\n<h2>What documents are necessary?</h2>\r\nPlease find the following checklist with documents necessary for the sale of a company:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Balance sheet and profit and loss account of the last three years</li>\r\n	<li>Tax declaration form of the company of the last three years</li>\r\n	<li>VAT declaration of the last three years</li>\r\n	<li>List of the fixed assets including a table of depreciations</li>\r\n	<li>Copy of the tenancy agreement</li>\r\n	<li>List of loans and creditors of the company (amount, due date, repayment plan and interest rate)</li>\r\n	<li>List of debtors of the company (amount and due date)</li>\r\n	<li>List of stock of merchandise separated by category including table of depreciations</li>\r\n	<li>List of pending legal disputes (if applicable)</li>\r\n	<li>List of external advisors (if applicable)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur advisors are happy to support you in organising and drawing up the necessary documents.\r\n<h2>What buyers should know</h2>\r\nThis question may come a little bit early to you since you have not reached the final decision to sell your company. However, it will surely help you to make the right decision. It is not only important to know, who the buyer is, but also what he or she wants to know when buying your company. The following are a few possible questions that you might be asked:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>How much money do I need to buy your company?</li>\r\n	<li>How high is the annual growth?</li>\r\n	<li>What is special, unique, out of the ordinary about your company?</li>\r\n	<li>What are the characteristics of your products or services?</li>\r\n	<li>What possible developments exist for your company?</li>\r\n	<li>Who is your main competitor?</li>\r\n	<li>What are the risks?</li>\r\n	<li>What kind of additional advantages can the buyer generate?</li>\r\n	<li>What is the situation of revenue in bad or in good times?</li>\r\n	<li>How big is the stock of merchandise?</li>\r\n	<li>How high is the indebtedness?</li>\r\n	<li>Is it planned that the seller will stay in the business for a certain period of time in order to train the new owner?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>The sales process</h2>\r\nBusiness Broker AG will draw up an individual marketing plan for your company and implement the steps gradually. The buyers located with the help of that system will then be invited for a personal interview.  We will check their qualifications and present your company only to potential buyers. The next step will be to organise a site inspection of your company, which will happen in a very discreet way. We recommend you only answer technical questions, whereas your advisor will take care of questions related to company figures and the purchase price, which may already be subject to negotiation.\r\n\r\nIn case the potential buyer is still interested in your company, we will receive an offer for you. Usually, such an offer depends on one or several conditions, such as the buyer\'s request to examine your financial documents in detail, look into your tenancy agreement or other materially relevant details.\r\n\r\nWe will present you all offers that we receive for your company and, together, we will consider all the pros and cons. At first sight, you might not be satisfied with some points, some may not be according to your expectations but others may be very positive.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we recommend you to examine the offers thoroughly in order to be able to reach a substantiated decision. Either you reject an offer, you make a counter offer or you accept an offer.\r\n\r\nOnce you and the buyer have come to terms, we will ensure that the conditions are fulfilled as soon as possible. At this point, some buyers search advise of external advisors. It is very important that you cooperate in such a process, if not, the buyer may get the impression that you are hiding something from him/her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as all the conditions are fulfilled, the sales contract will be drawn up and signed. Once the contract is signed, the payment will be effectuated and the company handed over to the buyer.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/tabid/62/Default.aspx?ct=sell\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Seller guideline','','inherit','closed','closed','','72-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 16:12:19','2015-12-18 16:12:19','',72,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/72-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(135,1,'2015-12-18 16:12:52','2015-12-18 16:12:52','<h2>Do you want to sell your company?</h2>\r\nUse the most successful European internet platform for company sale and decisively register your offer.

Conclusion</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>1. General information on company valuation</h3>\r\nOne must basically differentiate between the theoretical value of the company and the realisable value of the company: The theoretical value of the company can be determined using various methods, each method generates different values. Therefore, there is no right or wrong theoretical value of the company, but different values, which are varyingly plausible for different viewers.\r\n\r\nThe realisable value of the company can only be established for a non-listed company if the company is actually sold. It is always a snapshot.\r\n\r\nAn assessment can be divided roughly into two types of methods: the net asset value and the income value. With the intrinsic value method, the company value is made up from the rated capacity, minus the rated debt. Here the assets can be used at book value, replacement or liquidation value. Hidden reserves must be considered accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe evaluated value of a company, it is not enough to use only the intrinsic value. The tangible assets alone do not create value, if a corresponding income is not earned. It can sometimes also be the case that with very little tangible assets one can generate a high revenue. Therefore, a company’s earning power also plays an important role in the evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe income capitalisation methods show what can be earned on the existing assets. The earning power does not include the value of intangible assets such as components of the customer base, market position and reputation. It is also determined by the company’s strategy, the market situation and the capabilities of the management.\r\n<h3>2. Reasons and occasions for a company valuation</h3>\r\nThe reasons for carrying out a business valuation are varied. In the context of a corporate sale or succession planning, the business valuation is essential for determining the price. The company valuation is also a very valuable tool for corporate governance in strategy definition and selecting alternatives. Company valuations continue to be required in legal cases as part of an expert report as well as in the establishing and distributing inheritances.\r\n<h4>2.1 Company Sale/Succession Plan</h4>\r\nAs the owner of your company decides on either a sale or succession planning, it is important to assess the site by way of a company valuation. When evaluating a company is clear what value the company has at the time of the valuation. The right arguments can be found during the price negotiation phase by means of the factors analysed. The company value is therefore the same as an argumentation value. Different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic) are taken into account during the valuation. The argumentation value shows that the calculated value is generally not equal to the eventual price to be paid. There are additional specific and subjective aspects of negotiation.\r\n<h4>2.2 Strategy definition</h4>\r\nBased on a company valuation and the resulting lessons learned, improvement measures can be established in respect of a subsequent sale of the company. Since the value drivers of the shareholder value are crystalised in a valuation, it is possible to use this to (re)align strategy. It makes sense, for example, to check the value proposition of the individual cost components. The use of personnel, premises and the tied up capital (such as machinery or vehicles) should be scrutinised and checked rigorously for possible savings. On the revenue side it is critical if the generated revenue of a business unit also has a positive impact on the overall profitability of the company or if it pushes this down.\r\n<h4>2.3 Arbitration value</h4>\r\nWhen parties are in dispute, it may be necessary to determine the arbitration value of a company. As an example, the divorce process can be named here, where there will be a dispute over the amount of the developed assets in the form of the company value. Business Broker AG has experience in the preparation of court reports and takes on the corresponding orders.\r\n<h4>2.4 Inheritance</h4>\r\nWould you like to know what the value of your business is and what value you want to leave your descendants one day, then it is essential to determine a company\'s value, which is not only theoretically correct, but can also be achieved. We will help you determine a value that is not beyond the market and based on assumptions, one that has a meaningful relationship to reality.\r\n\r\nIf you have undergone the painful experience of having lost a family member who has built up a company over the years and you (possibly jointly with other heirs) are now faced with the issue of succession, it is imperative for the parties to use a comprehensible company valuation oriented to market prices as a decision basis.\r\n<h3>3. Company valuation methods</h3>\r\nThere are a variety of company valuation methods, which as described above are divided into two basic categories: intrinsic value method and discounted earnings method. In addition, there are market value methods (multipliers, multiples), which are used for the valuation and which with other methods can make the obtained results plausible. It analyses what has already been paid in past transactions (Transaction Multiples) or what will be paid on the stock exchange for market prices (Trading Multiples). Furthermore, there are corporate policies that are theoretically correct, but not relevant in practice for SMEs, since they are simply not appropriate enough or are of too little importance or not documented enough (e.g. the valuation using the real options theory). In practice it is customary to use a valuation mix of the relevant methods. The valuation mix applied may vary industry to industry, however, it is based on the experience and the expertise of completed projects.\r\n\r\nBusiness Broker AG has extensive practical know-how, which they can draw on in each individual project valuation.\r\n<h4>3.1 Entity vs. Equity Approach</h4>\r\nTwo different perspectives and approaches can be pursued with all company valuation methods.\r\n\r\nThe entity approach takes into account the sources of income accruing to the equity investors and lenders. In other words, it is valued from the perspective of the overall company (Enterprise Value, Entity) and the gross value of the company is ascertained. If you subtract the debt, you get the net value of the company, which equals the equity. When selling a business it is the net value of the company that is relevant. This can also be derived directly from the equity approach. Only the equity holders who are entitled to sources income are capitalised. The direct derivation of the corporate value using the equity method is done, for example, in the stock assessment.\r\n<h4>3.2 Intrinsic-value method</h4>\r\nWith the intrinsic value method, all existing assets are in the balance sheet, so the assets of the company are summarised. The intrinsic value is usually calculated on going concern values (so-called reproductive values). All assets together form the total of the company’s assets and referred to as the gross asset value. To work out the net asset value of the company, i.e. the intrinsic value of equity, the debt (all debt and liabilities of the company) is deducted from the gross asset value.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"342\" />\r\n<h5>3.2.1 Book value, hidden reserves and deferred taxes</h5>\r\nThe assets in the financial accounting (balance control) represent book values and need to be revised first. The difference between the book values and the actual values includes undisclosed reserves to which the book values should be adjusted. The deferred taxes on hidden reserves can be drawn in since a positive influence is achieved on the income statement or a higher income is reported in a future release of hidden reserves. The deferred taxes can be taken into account when calculating the net asset values, in which the valuation difference (between book values and market values) is multiplied by half the tax rate and subtracted from the calculated net asset value. The use of half the tax rate takes into account, on the one hand, the subsequent collection of the taxes in time (time value of money) and, on the other hand, the scheduling of when to release the hidden reserves (the tax burden will not turn out quite so high).\r\n<h5>3.2.2 Going concern value (reproduction or replacement cost)</h5>\r\nWith the intrinsic value for the going concern value, assets are considered to be the value that they cost at today’s replacement cost at market prices. The continuation value thus indicates how much the replacement cost would be to reproduce the company. The acquisition values at current prices are used, from which the depreciation (consumption value) is deducted on grounds of age, resulting in the replacement value.\r\n<h5>3.2.3 Liquidation Value</h5>\r\nThe liquidation value is the value of the assets that can be attained after deduction of liabilities and liquidation costs. It should be noted that in a liquidation due to the tight time frame and because of the possible orientation of the assets to the purpose and the specialisation of the company, it may result in lower prices.\r\n<h5>3.2.4 Non-operational assets</h5>\r\nWhen valuing a company using the intrinsic value method, the operational assets are summed up in the first place. The company may have, however, additional non-operational assets such as real estate, which are not related to the operational activities, or there is excess liquidity that is not needed for the operation (this is not usually the case for smaller companies). These non-operational assets are to be listed separately or added in addition to the net intrinsic value and shown separately.\r\n<h5>3.2.5 Conclusion for the intrinsic value method</h5>\r\nThe intrinsic value is an inventory of existing holdings (assets), i.e. the existing matter of a company. The net intrinsic value represents the effective value of the equity, i.e. the corrected tax values of assets of the hidden reserves, minus the debts or liabilities of the company. The intrinsic value can be seen as a lower limit in the valuation of a company because tangible assets at the valuation point are physically present.\r\n<h4>3.3 Earning value methods</h4>\r\nThe earning value methods evaluate a company based on the anticipated sources of income, which the company will generate for the company owners in the future with the existing substance. The future sources of income may be in profits or cash flows. The individual earning value methods can be distinguished depending on the type of revenue. So the widespread Discounted Cash Flow method, valid as an assessment standard, is based on a cash flow factor and the pure earning value methods and also the excess profit methods to a profit factor. So-called dividend models (e.g. dividend discounting or the dividend growth model) are based on expected revenue in the form of dividends that accrue to the shareholders in the future. The dividend models are not listed here, because these are relevant for the stock assessment and also for listed companies with a constant dividend.\r\n<h5>3.3.1 Basic principles of the Earning Value Calculation</h5>\r\n<strong>3.3.1.1 Time value of the money and consideration of risks</strong>\r\nEarning value methods are all based on the same methodology: Anticipate revenue that accrues to the company owners in the future will be adjusted to the time of evaluation. The basic argument for this is the time value of money. This means that a franc is worth more today than tomorrow, as the money today can be invested at a specified interest rate (risk free market interest rate). In addition to the time value of money, the risk is taken into account, with which the returns vary in the future, what is referred to as so-called volatility. The higher the volatility, the higher the risk and therefore the cost of capital with which the time delayed revenues are discounted, i.e. are transferred to the valuation date. The cost of capital is an interest rate that considers both the temporal component mentioned, as well as the revealed risk. Discounting specifically means that a future form of income (FS) is divided by the term (1 + interest rate)<sup>period (T)</sup> to obtain the present value of the income (present value). The revenue can be profits or cash flows, which accrue at the end of each fiscal year to the company owner.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"621\" height=\"77\" />\r\n<strong>3.3.1.2 Determining the cost of capital</strong>\r\nThe amount of the capital costs has a major impact on a company\'s value, since the expected forms of revenue will be compared when evaluating the cost of capital and discounted at the WACC. The cost of capital consists of both the rates of return of equity (cost of equity) and debt capital (borrowing costs). To calculate the cost of capital, the cost of equity is weighted with the equity and debt capital costs by the percentage of debt. With the cost of debt, corporate taxes are also taken into account because the interest expenses are tax deductible. Hence the term tax-adjusted (WACC - Weighted Average Cost of Capital) is used (see Section 3.3.2 Discounted cash flow method). Equity is the most expensive capital. The required rate of return of the equity investors is much higher than the borrowing rate. By borrowing funds (for example in the form of a bank loan), the total capital costs are reduced, thereby changing the financing structure (it is the so-called financial leverage effect).\r\n\r\nThe required rate of equity can be determined using the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model). Here a risk premium and, where appropriate, risk increases for the limited tradability (for listed companies) and the size (at small and medium-sized, unlisted companies) are added to a rate perceived as being without risk (e.g. 10-year Swiss government bond). The risk premium is derived from the product of the equity beta ß<sub>EK</sub> and the market risk premium or market returns. The equity beta beta ß<sub>EK</sub> indicates how much the stock price fluctuates compared to the market (e.g. in Switzerland SMI or SPI). The empirical determination of the equity beta ß<sub>EK</sub>implies a stock market listing. Since each company has a different funding structure and capital structure, this must be taken into account when calculating the beta. This is done with the so-called Hamada\'s formula, which transforms the beta values ß<sub>GK</sub> of the Stock Exchange (this refers only to the business risk) into the ß<sub>EK</sub>, which in addition to financial risk even incorporate the company-specific financial risk. For unlisted companies, determining the cost of equity is more difficult because there are no empirical data on market beta derivation. In determining the betas, only the experience of past transactions, especially in the field of small and medium companies, plays a very important role. In addition, comparative values of publicly traded companies in the same industry can be used.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"546\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.2 Discounted Cash Flow Method</h5>\r\nThe discounted cash flow method (DCF) is, as the name suggests, a cash flow-based company valuation method. First, the costs incurred in the future, so-called free cash flows are derived or predicted, and then using the tax-adjusted average cost of capital WACC<sub>s</sub> discounted at the valuation date.\r\n\r\n<strong>3.3.2.1 Calculation of Free Cash Flows (FCF)</strong>\r\nFree cash flow estimates the cash flow from business operations, which, after investment in net operating working capital and fixed assets into the company\'s owners are, so to speak, freely available.\r\n\r\nFree Cash Flow at Entity Level is derived as follows:\r\n<p class=\"paraBorder\">EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes)\r\n- Taxes on EBIT\r\n= NOPAT (Net operating profit after taxes)\r\n+ Depreciation on intangible assets\r\n+ Amortisation of intangible assets\r\n- Changes in Net Working Capital\r\n- Capital Expenditures (Capex)\r\n- Changes in Goodwill\r\n<strong>= Unlevered Free Cash Flow</strong></p>\r\nThe DCF method according to the entity approach is considered as Best Practice, whereby the free cash flows are discounted to entity level with the tax-adjusted average cost of capital WACC<sub>s</sub>. The tax adjustment with the WACC is necessary because in the calculation of free cash flow, taxes are directly deducted from EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). This is theoretically incorrect because the borrowing costs are tax deductible and so taxes must not be subtracted directly from the EBIT, but from the EBT (earnings before taxes) - (disclosure of too high taxes). Since in practice it is difficult, however, to predict the exact applicable taxes, the \"incorrectness\" mentioned in the WACC<sub>s</sub> is taken into account, so when determining the cost of debt, the taxes are incorporated and so the taxes that have been estimated too high are corrected again.\r\n\r\nAn income statement plan is drawn up for the next 4-5 years, starting from a valuation point. A simplified scenario is worked with for the time periods after the 4-5 years. A so-called residual value is determined. Here, the assumption is made that the investment currently meets the depreciation, so that the free cash flow to be discounted on a straight agrees on the entity level with the NOPAT (Net Operating Profit after Taxes). The gross value of the company consists of the actuarial value of free cash flow at the Entity level together with the cash value of the residual value.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the net value of the company, the value of equity, the net debt is subtracted from the company\'s gross value.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"456\" />\r\n<strong>3.3.2.2 Residual value, planning horizon, eternal growth</strong>\r\nThe difficulty in defining the planning horizon is the weighting of the residual value. The greater the number of planning years, the more difficult it is to plan the future free cash flows, because the quantity of the residual value is smaller than the value of the company. It therefore makes sense to forecast only about 4-5 years, as these are justifiable and understandable, and therefore accept a higher proportion of the residual value at the company\'s value.\r\n\r\nIn the planning of future profits or free cash flows one can make the assumption that profits should have an eternal growth after the planning horizon. In the denominator of the DCF formula, the growth rate g is then subtracted from the WACC<sub>s</sub>. The assumption of perpetual growth NOPAT is a very strong statement and must be viewed with great caution and above all provided with a reasonable and founded justification.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.3 Pure earning value method</h5>\r\nAside from a detailed planning of the future years, one can perform a simplified earning value calculation. Here it is assumed that a perpetual profit (before interest payments) can be achieved and this profit corresponds as the equivalent to the free cash flow entity. This stems from the fact that there are no changes in working capital and that investments just meet the depreciation, which implies that only replacement investments will be made. The resulting profit is regarded as eternal and is hereby discounted with the non-tax adjusted WACC in this case, because the taxes in the calculation of EBIT (earnings before interest) are calculated correctly.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel07.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"208\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.4 Goodwill</h5>\r\nThe difference between the revenue value and the intrinsic value is called goodwill. Goodwill describes part of the purchase price, which is paid in addition to the value of the material elements of capital, for the customer base, reputation, brand, market position, access to the work performance of employees and for other intangible assets. The amount of goodwill sometimes depends on the industry sector. If a company sells a capital intensive business, the goodwill in relation to the sales price is considerably lower than in a pure service company, where there are tangible assets.\r\n<h5>3.3.5 Average value method (Mean value method)</h5>\r\nThe average method involves a weighted averaging of asset and revenue value.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel08.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"367\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.6 Excess profit methods</h5>\r\nThe intrinsic value method and the discounted cash flow method can be connected with each other using the excess profit process. Here recoverable excess profit is added to the gross asset value over a certain period T. The excess profit is the difference between the budgeted profit before tax (earnings before interest) and the normal profit, which is the product of asset value and the non-tax-adjusted cost of capital (WACC). The budgeted profit can be higher than normal profit, for example due to a strong market position, due to competitive advantages, but it is time limited. The excess profit adopted for a certain period is capitalised with the present value annuity factor, composed as in the following formula:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"484\" />\r\n<h4>3.4 Market Value Method (multipliers, multiples)</h4>\r\nThe corporate value can be determined with publicly listed companies by the prices paid on the stock exchange (trading multiples) or compared with the acquisitions, transaction prices (Transaction multiples) already paid for by the company. Trading multiples and transaction multiples are summarised under the term of market multiples (multipliers). Important Market multiples are revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, net profit multiple, the price-earnings ratio (PER or P/E ratio) or the Market-to-book ratio, where the multiples are always a multiple of the listed figures. With unlisted companies a comparison is made with prices paid on the stock market, however, proven to be relatively difficult. A comparison may be of use when establishing a price range.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"361\" />\r\nIn the multiple-evaluation it is important that it starts from the same base. Either one rates at the corporate level (enterprise value, gross, unlevered) or at the equity level (equity value, net, levered). It is also useful to form an average of the individual multiples, so as to balance a possible bias or offset. Moreover, it makes sense to form an average over several years for each included Multiple.\r\n<h4>3.5 Ownership profit (EBITDA)</h4>\r\nParticular attention is given to the important EBITDA Multiple. EBITDA stands for <i>Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation (fixed assets) and amortisation (on intangible assets)</i>. This represents an important tool in corporate valuation especially for small and medium-sized companies. This multiplier is from the financing structure and influenced by the state of the investment cycle and therefore one of the most meaningful multipliers. A company that has just invested finds itself confronted with higher depreciation and a lower profit than a company that has made no investments over time.\r\n\r\nThe owner of earnings based on the EBITDA represents the actual cash flow generated, adjusted to reflect corrections and before depreciation. If one adds the gross salary (including benefits) to the EBITDA that the owner of the company has paid out to himself, this results in the owner earnings (EBITDA level). Multiplied by a certain factor, this represents a fundamental price indicator in particular regarding the evaluation of the profitability of small and medium-sized companies, which a DCF valuation may not make much sense. The origin of the term: owner’s profit (EBITDA), owner’s cash flows come from the Anglo-American term. Usually the owners themselves are active in the company and will benefit from various services provided by the company for him. In relation to an employee he would have to finance for such benefits for himself from his work income.\r\n\r\nThe starting point for calculating the owner’s profit at EBITDA level is always the EBITDA according to the financial statements. To which the following adjustments or corrections are to be made:\r\n<div class=\"divBorder\">\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>EBITDA according to the financial statements</strong></li>\r\n	<li>Addition of the gross salary of the owner or owners (including bonuses, bonuses and benefits)</li>\r\n	<li>Addition of additional charges which are not included in the gross wage</li>\r\n	<li>One-off addition/subtraction, non-recurring expenses/revenues, which were debited/credited to the P&amp;L account</li>\r\n	<li>Addition/subtraction income/expenses not operationally required, which were debited/credited to the P&amp;L account</li>\r\n	<li>Addition/subtraction of income/expenses of a private nature, which were billed to the business</li>\r\n	<li>Addition/Subtraction formation/release of hidden reserves</li>\r\n	<li>Addition of easily and quickly realisable savings</li>\r\n	<li><strong>= owner’s profit at EBITDA level</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\nWith over 100 sales of companies in the past four years, Business Broker AG has built up a very valuable database in terms of multiples, which are actually paid in the area of small and medium sized companies. Of course, this requires a prior revision of the financial statements as listed above.\r\n<h3>4. Procedure during a company valuation</h3>\r\nTo perform a meaningful due diligence, regardless of the method chosen, some key steps are to be considered:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Revision of the financial statements</li>\r\n	<li>Business valuation with a method mix</li>\r\n	<li>Comparison and interpretation of results</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>4.1 The revision of financial statements</h4>\r\nThe balance sheets and income statements for the past 3 years must be revised for non-operating, and extraordinary personal income and expenses or assets and liabilities. Examples of this can also include rented business premises, which are shown as an expense in the P&amp;L account, but are not required for the business activities. Or the owner runs an expensive car and pays for its leasing costs through the business. These additional expenditures are to be neutralised or taken out.\r\n<h4>4.2 Company valuation Method mix</h4>\r\nThe presentation and selection of assessment methods always gives rise to discussions. First, it should be noted that a company valuation method is limited to its own explanatory power. In our experience, the mix of company valuation methods has proven successful. The intrinsic value can be regarded as a lower limit in the definition of a bandwidth value. Thereafter, the earning value is determined using the discounted cash flow method and is weighted and combined together with the earning value discussed by multiples, which is already a temporal and methodological average, according to the average value method (this is often the mean value method). So we combine the discounted cash flow method with our extensive knowledge from existing transactions (Transaction multiples).\r\n<h4>4.3 Comparison and interpretation of the results</h4>\r\n<h5>4.3.1 Plausibility check</h5>\r\nThe plausibility of the valuation results can be done with technically simple valuation methods, like the pure income capitalisation method is. This makes sense particularly with the discounted cash flow method, in which the cost of capital, the planning figures and the residual value represent particularly value-sensitive factors, this makes sense. Furthermore, plausibility checks can be made with multiples. Crucial to the plausibility test, however, is the experience of the consultant from other projects. An experienced consultant can use his knowledge of the existing company valuations that come from different industries and are characterised by a variety of company-specific traits, for profit. He has developed over time a practical and goal-oriented perspective and is able to assess very carefully whether it makes sense to determine company value and apply a mix of methods or not.\r\n\r\nWith a company valuation, assumptions are made regarding the sales development and also the development of costs (staff costs, material costs, other operating expenses). In addition, with the earning value method, a certain cost of capital is set and used for discounting the flow of revenue. As the future is uncertain, it makes sense to work with different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic), especially with regard to the sales of a company, which may depend in particular on the industry or market development, and with respect to different levels of capital cost percentages (company-specific risks). With the change in the cost of capital, it is easy to see how sensitively the earning value reacts.\r\n<h5>4.3.2 Traceability</h5>\r\nIt is essential that the assumptions are critically analysed, especially with the earning value methods (specially the DCF method). One deals intensively with the company\'s business model and value factors, which responds sensitively to an assessment. It is not done with a purely technical valuation on the basis of a business plan or planning figures (plan P&amp;L statements, projected balance sheets, schedule of cash flows). The assumptions must be readily comprehensible, so that an outsider sees and also understands the most important value driver on the valuation of a business.\r\n<h3>5. Conclusion</h3>\r\nThe company valuation is not about finding the absolutely correct value. Company values do not represent pure objective values, instead they are based on many subjective assumptions. The point is to determine a value bandwidth, which can be used for plausibility and communication purposes. The bandwidth value of the earning value comes from the fact that different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic) and various other assumptions are made. The income/cost development is evaluated and so are the business and financial risks of the company and the industry development of different variants. A lower limit is determined based on the intrinsic value that is physically present and which varies depending on the capital intensity of operations. Depending on the scenario, then the return value and the goodwill to be attained are specified as the difference between the earning and net asset value. All the results obtained in the context of a company valuation require expert assessment and a plausibility check. Only those who can see the value driving factors and an assessment of the underlying assumptions in detail, will be in a position to interpret the calculated value of the company.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div class=\"callToAction_button\"><a class=\"callToAction_buttonText\" href=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/tabid/62/Default.aspx?ct=val\">contact</a></div>\r\n<span class=\"callToAction_text\">Ask for our no-obligation information pack:</span>','Valuation methods','','inherit','closed','closed','','80-revision-v1','','','2015-12-18 16:14:15','2015-12-18 16:14:15','',80,'http://localhost/startupbroker/2015/12/18/80-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(137,1,'2015-12-18 16:15:06','2015-12-18 16:15:06','<h1>Succession Advice</h1>\r\n<strong>Business Broker AG has already supported more than 300 successions.

We do not only determine and interpret the theoretical value of a company according to the various recognised methods, but we are also skilled in making very concrete transactions based on realisable price recommendations.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe valuation of a company is an extremely challenging task. The basis for any professional review is the revision of the figures in order to submit a satisfactory plan for future years and the meaningful application of the various recognised methods for corporate valuations. Each method provides different values – a valuation is of little use without a professional interpretation of individual results and the knowledge of realised projects.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for a company valuation are numerous.

Subjects implicated are balance sheets, people and material resources, strategic positioning, legal and financial risks and environmental liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe due diligence has basically an informative role, it reduces the information asymmetry between buyers and sellers and provides the necessary information for a qualified decision. Based on the information provided, authorative parameters can be made plausible for the evaluation (evaluation function). If the buyer is not a natural person, but a company instead (represented by its decision makers), then the due diligence has an important accountability function, because the managers can document a careful, conscientious deal for its stakeholders (exculpation function).\r\n\r\nDifferent types of due diligence are distinguished between (e.g. pre due diligence, pre acquisition due diligence, post-completion due diligence, post acquisition due diligence), which differ depending on the time of implementation as well as the objective. Due diligence takes place in the usual sales process, if the parties have agreed in principle and the conditions are specified in a so-called \"Term Sheet\" and in a non-binding offer to purchase, and this is accepted by the seller. After due diligence has been carried out, this \"Term Sheet\" is the basis for the development of the sales contracts. Only when the deal is signed does it become legally binding.\r\n\r\nFor the implementation of DD, the seller or his advisors set up a data room, in which the necessary documents and information are available. The data room can be made available physically or virtually.\r\n<h2>Analytical focus of a due diligence inspection</h2>\r\nThe due diligence inspection covers the following areas:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Legal Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Tax Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Financial Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Market / Commercial / Strategic Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Environmental Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Insurance Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Technical Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>IT Due Diligence</li>\r\n	<li>Human Resources Due Diligence</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs the above criteria suggests, this list can be extended or shortened. Usually the seller presents the buyer or his advisors with a (wish) list of documents to be examined to. For an efficient process, we recommend that both parties agree on a joint due diligence list (Index). The buyers can prepare themselves and the seller can inform the buyer early enough if certain desired documents do not exist (for example, only a few SMEs have a business plan drawn up for the next 5 years or a detailed market and competitive analysis).\r\n\r\nThe inspector summarises the results in a due diligence report. Quantifiable results are used to validate the sales price. Non-quantifiable results lead to the recording of specific guarantees in the purchase agreement.\r\n<h2>Success factors in the implementation of due diligence</h2>\r\nThose seeking an efficient and cost-minimising due diligence review, specify the analysis focus of the due diligence on the company to be audited (type, size), the deal structure (Asset vs. Deal. Share Deal) and the objectives of the client. It makes little sense to conduct a thorough tax due diligence if the company is taken over in the context of an asset deal.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Due Diligence','','inherit','closed','closed','','56-revision-v1','','','2015-12-23 16:48:45','2015-12-23 16:48:45','',56,'http://7hobbits.com/56-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(164,1,'2015-12-23 16:49:32','2015-12-23 16:49:32','<h1>Become self-employed</h1>\r\nA company can be set up quickly. Business cards can be printed easily and cheaply, and a website is also online in no time. The real challenge in independence is to be successful with your business concept for the long term. The fact that many young entrepreneurs fail in this challenge, demonstrates the following characteristics.\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Start-ups</dt><dd>11,000 new companies are founded in Switzerland every year. Approximately 95% of the new companies employ 1 to 4 employees.\r\n\r\n</dd><dt>Survival rate</dt><dd>Less than three of four companies survive the second year. After fives years every second company goes bankrupt. Statistics from Germany also confirm that young companies are in particular danger of going bankrupt.\r\n\r\n</dd><dt>Insolvency</dt><dd>In Switzerland around 4.400 companies have become insolvent due to payment difficulties in 2011. Losses in the region of 3 to 4,7 billion francs arise annually as a result of insolvencies. 30.099 company insolvencies were counted in Germany in the past year.\r\n\r\n</dd><dt>Sizes</dt><dd>88% of all companies in Switzerland are so called micro companies (up to 9 employees). 99.7% pay to the small to medium sized companies category (up to 249 employees). In Germany the small to medium sized companies also count as the pillars of the economy. 99.3% of all companies are small to medium sized businesses, approximately 2 Mio, of which 81% are categorised as micro companies.\r\n\r\n</dd><dt>Legal form</dt><dd>Barely half of all companies are sole proprietorships.\r\n\r\n</dd></dl>In addition to the risks and difficulties, there are also many opportunities for the self-employed: There are few entrepreneurs who complain about their status. Employees of large companies, however, are often unsatisfied. It may therefore be worthwhile to at least consider the option of your own company. But what do you need?\r\n\r\nHonest answers to the following questions provide a sound basis for your decision:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Why do I want to be self-employed?</li>\r\n	<li>What goals do I want to achieve through self-employment?</li>\r\n	<li>Do I have all the necessary skills to build a business and to establish it in the market?</li>\r\n	<li>Is my previous track record enough to create confidence among potential customers?</li>\r\n	<li>Do I have an amiable entrepreneurial personality?</li>\r\n	<li>Am I ready to implement my goals even against resistance?</li>\r\n	<li>Can I manage my available resources sensibly?</li>\r\n	<li>Can I keep my head in turbulent situations?</li>\r\n	<li>Can I motivate myself and deal confidently with setbacks?</li>\r\n	<li>What is my financial capacity?</li>\r\n	<li>What do important people in my life (partner, family, friends) think about my planned self-employment?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDo you therefore have to be born as a ready-made entrepreneur? Certain conditions must be fulfilled for a successful entrepreneurial activity. It is usually an advantage if you become self-employed in an area, in which you are already specialised. A certain degree of extroversion makes it easier to talk to people. Also an understanding of the personal environment, your own perseverance and the ability to deal with disappointments can facilitate the start into entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Become self-employed','','inherit','closed','closed','','58-revision-v1','','','2015-12-23 16:49:32','2015-12-23 16:49:32','',58,'http://7hobbits.com/58-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(165,1,'2015-12-23 16:50:28','2015-12-23 16:50:28','<h1>Buy a company instead of founding a new one</h1>\r\nOf the 11,000 plus new businesses set up each year in Switzerland, only about half survive the first 5 years, the rest have disappeared from the market within a short time. We are in an environment in which the survival rate for young companies is obviously overestimated. This shocking statistic is based on three factors that new entrepreneurs are often overlooked: Poor location and / or poor product, insufficient capitalisation and excessive demands.\r\n\r\nAnyone starting a business, usually prepares meticulously at the start and creates a detailed business plan – one would assume. Studies show that the higher the means needed for a start-up, the greater the chance of survival - the more financial resources required, the more time is spent in preparation. These types of business are not established as often, but they survive more often.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the start-up companies, about 11,000 businesses in Switzerland are passed on or sold to a successor each year. This provides many opportunities for individuals who want to start their own.\r\n\r\nThe chances of success in corporate purchasing as opposed to starting up is better in many cases: The buyer of an existing company can assume that the owner of the company has chosen the right location and included the appropriate products in his portfolio, otherwise the company would have stopped operating long ago. To overcome the last hurdle - the excessive demands - the majority of business owners have at their disposal the new owner with advice and assistance.\r\n\r\nWhen a company is being set up, the use of financial resources is often underestimated, this is much less the case when buying. The demand for liquidity can be estimated much better. In addition, the buyer already achieves the first turnover on the day he takes over and he has the sales history from the past. The risk of overly optimistic revenue and profit margin forecast is significantly lowered.\r\n\r\nEven with a purchase there is still the entrepreneurial risk. Buying, however, is a promising alternative to starting up.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Buy a company instead of founding a new one','','inherit','closed','closed','','60-revision-v1','','','2015-12-23 16:50:28','2015-12-23 16:50:28','',60,'http://7hobbits.com/60-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(166,1,'2015-12-23 16:51:01','2015-12-23 16:51:01','<h1>Strategic Acquisitions – Merger &amp; Acquisition (M&amp;A) – SME</h1>\r\nMergers &amp; Acquisitions (M &amp; A) gives companies the opportunity to grow by organic growth and through acquisitions.

The purchase of a company may be difficult and it is important that you remain cool-headed.\r\n\r\nBusiness Broker AG offers many different companies, which might be suitable for you. Check whether a company suits your talents, your capacities and your lifestyle. However, please do not forget that the perfect company does not exist.

This will help you to sort out your targets and your motivation, your financial and your personal starting point:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>A business owner is called a business owner because he/she does business!</li>\r\n	<li>Important questions to be considered and answered previous to the purchase\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Establish or purchase a company</li>\r\n	<li>What should you pay attention to when buying a company?</li>\r\n	<li>Why do you wish to buy a company?</li>\r\n	<li>What is your time frame to find the right company?</li>\r\n	<li>Are you willing to invest an important part of your financial funds into a company?</li>\r\n	<li>Are you sufficiently independent to take decisions by yourself?</li>\r\n	<li>Is your family supporting you as a business owner?</li>\r\n	<li>Are you open in your search or are you looking for a specific kind of company?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you have appropriate expectations?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you need security?</li>\r\n	<li>How do you define success?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>The purchase process</li>\r\n	<li>How does a broker help you?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you need a lawyer?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>A business owner is called a business owner because he/she does business</h2>\r\nTo buy a company is a major step and a challenge for which you have to overcome your fears and concerns. Almost 90% of the people, who purchase a company have never been the manager of a company before. A person who always wants to be on the safe side should never start their own business.\r\n\r\nWhen you start your search, you should consider that being a business owner is more than just a job. It means a change of lifestyle. Very often, such a change is considerable: normally you work longer hours, you have to make all decisions by yourself and you need to be willing to do all kinds of jobs. In other words: you are responsible for all kinds of work necessary for the success of a company and to keep it going. In reality, this means you have to wipe the floor or change a light bulb yourself.\r\n\r\nWhat are the reasons for a private person to become a business owner?\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Take your destiny in your hands</li>\r\n	<li>Proud of service or product</li>\r\n	<li>Flexibility</li>\r\n	<li>Financial opportunities</li>\r\n	<li>Recognition</li>\r\n	<li>Safety</li>\r\n	<li>Privacy</li>\r\n	<li>Status</li>\r\n	<li>Contact with clients and staff</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Important questions which should be considered and answered previous to the purchase of a company</h2>\r\n<h3>a) Establish or purchase a company?</h3>\r\nApproximately 50% of all cases of insolvency occur during the first four years after the foundation of a company. This alarming statistic shows that people often do not consider three important factors before they establish a company: bad location and/or poor quality of a product, insufficient financial reserves and, last but not least, they are overwhelmed by demands.\r\n\r\nWhen taking over an already existing business you can be sure that the location that the founder of the company had chosen is good and that the right products are in the portfolio, otherwise the company would not have existed for a long time. In order to manage the third point, being overwhelmed by the demands, it is advisable to accept the help of the former company owner.  Most business owners are willing to support the new owner on their way to a successful business independency.\r\n<h3>b) What you should pay attention to when purchasing a company?</h3>\r\nUnfortunately, the initial question of many potential buyers is the price of a company and only as a second thought they consider what can be earned from it.\r\n\r\nImportant is the question, how much capital you need in order to finance the purchase price. However, there is no point in considering a purchase of a company if the requested amount of funds is higher than what you are able to finance.\r\n\r\nBuy a company, which you find easy to identify with. Being a proud business owner is an essential ingredient for success. On the other hand, the firm shall generate sufficient earnings in order to guarantee the coverage of your cost of living as well as the financial costs.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, consider the potential of a company, which may still be conceiled. What can be improved to make the company more profitable? A saying goes: \"Don\'t buy a company that cannot  be improved!\"\r\n<h3>c) Why do you wish to buy a company?</h3>\r\nIf you are not really motivated to buy a company, let it be. You must be entirely committed to become a business owner and this includes the right motivation. Being a business owner still is the basis of the \"great American dream\", but this does not mean that it is everybody\'s dream.\r\n\r\nIf working in a large organisation does not satisfy you anymore, going to work everyday only means earning money to you or if you have a job without any perspectives, then being independent may be the right option for you.\r\n<h3>d) What time-frame do you have to find the suitable company?</h3>\r\nIf you consider purchasing a company in two years you should start to gather the necessary information already now. However, there is no point in starting to search the right company now. Each company you find today is ready to be sold immediately.\r\n<h3>e) Are you willing to invest the most important part of your capital into a new company?</h3>\r\nThe purchase of an own company is an important financial investment. If you are a person that does not want to run any risks, also from a financial point of view, you should reconsider your decision to purchase an own company.\r\n<h3>f) Are you sufficiently independent to take all your decisions by yourself?</h3>\r\nIf you run a small business, you have to take many decisions. You are the boss and you are responsible. All decisions are your decisions, whether they are wrong or right. You will take wrong decisions for which you must bear the consequences. Are you able to cope with such a situation and do you have the strength to continue after such a failure? If you are constantly concerned and will have sleepless nights, an own company may not be the ideal option for you.\r\n<h3>g) Is your family supporting you as a business owner?</h3>\r\nIf your family, especially your partner, does not entirely agree with your decision, you should reconsider becoming a business owner. It is mandatory that your partner supports you. He or she has to know that being the owner of a company is very time-consuming. On the other hand, being your own boss means very often that your working hours are more flexible and offers the possibility once in a while to enjoy a free afternoon with your family.\r\n<h3>h) Are you open in your search or are you looking for a specific kind of company?</h3>\r\nIf you consider buying a company, it is advisable to be open to any kind of opportunity. There are many different companies and you should not narrow down your choice. Watch out for a company that guarantees you the income that you need (or at least the opportunity to do so), a company that you are able to finance and, last but not least, a company which offers opportunities to be successful by working hard.\r\n<h3>i) Are your expectations appropriate?</h3>\r\nIt is important that you keep your feet on the ground when defining your expectations. Many owners have built up their business over many years, have invested time and energy and it often represents their entire fortune. Many sellers will be willing to support you financially for the purchase of the company, however, they will not give you any presents.\r\n<h3>j) Do you need security?</h3>\r\nIf you need security, being a business owner is not the right option for you. Even if you examine all books and documents, you can never be sure since such figures are from the past. A new owner always brings changes along, no matter how small such changes are.  Everyone has a different way of managing a company and times change fast. Consider a company under the aspect of its potential for improvement. Naturally, a company\'s past financial data is important, however it does not give any guarantee for the future. You are the guarantee!\r\n<h3>k) What is the secret of success?</h3>\r\nIt is essential that you have enough financial assets to buy the company of your dreams and to be able to make the necessary amendments. As the starting phase may be difficult, you should be in possession of sufficient financial reserves.\r\n\r\nHowever, being successful or not depends also on factors that you are able to influence in a significant way: Your willingness to work hard and long hours especially in the beginning. Successful business owners claim to be at the same time secretary, vendor, bookkeeper and manager. That is exactly the attitude that will lead you to success! Think of not only being a \"planer\" - think of being a \"doer\"!\r\n<h2>Purchase process</h2>\r\nHow does one buy a company? There is no right or wrong way to do it. The important thing is that you get answers to all your questions and that the information, which is necessary, is available in order to help you to make the right decisions.\r\n\r\nThe following illustrates the usual process:\r\n<h3>a) Gathering of essential facts and figures</h3>\r\nIn the beginning, get information on prices, conditions, earnings, revised earnings and the general situation. For all companies for sale Business Broker AG draws up a short company description in which you will find the most important information.\r\n<h3>b) Visit the company</h3>\r\nIn order to check whether you like the location and the visual appearance, go and visit the company as a client. It would be too early to have a discussion with the owner. If it is unusual or difficult to visit the company as a client, then arrange a meeting with the seller.\r\n<h3>c) Insist on answers to your questions</h3>\r\nIf you like the company you should start trying to get answers to your questions. For example: What is the cost for the rent? For how many more years does the tenancy agreement run? How high was the turnover during the last few years? Is the seller in possession of figures, which prove his statements? At that moment it is not yet necessary to examine in detail the seller\'s books. At a later stage, there will be enough time for such an examination by means of a due diligence. It is now first and foremost important to get the answers that will influence your decision whether to buy the company or not.\r\n\r\nWhat you should pay attention to:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How long does the company exist already?Normally, if a company has existed for a long period of time, this confirms that such company is profitable. It is not without reason that this firm has been on the market for many years. It shows that the owner had chosen the right location and the right product.</li>\r\n	<li>How long has the current owner been in charge?An essential criterion for your decision to buy is information about the current owner. As a rule, the longer a company was in possession of the same owner, the more successful a company is. Nobody keeps a company if one does not earn money on it.</li>\r\n	<li>For what reason is the owner selling the company?This is a very important question! The actual reason for the sale will influence the seller\'s flexibility regarding the purchase price and the conditions of payment. If an owner has taken over the firm only six month ago and claims to want to retire now, you should get sceptical. However, do not forget that business people often get tired of a branch after a certain period of time and start to look for a new challenge. The question of the reason for the selling is very important, therefore, you should insist on an answer.</li>\r\n	<li>Profit and Loss account of small and mid-sized companiesLike any private person, companies try to pay as few taxes as possible. Accordingly, many expenses in the books are private expenses of the owner. It is worthwhile to have a closer look at the various expenses (costs for vehicles, travel expenses, expenses for representational activities, etc.). For example, the trip to Southern France, was it really a business trip? The company car, does it serve only for business purposes? We will support you in order to get these questions answered.\r\n\r\nHowever, when doing such research, please do not forget that all and any figures relate to the past. There is no guarantee what the future will bring. What kind of policy for expenses will you implement when owning the businesses? To what turnover will your ideas and your hard work lead? The company\'s future is in your hands!</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>d) Evaluate the company</h3>\r\nMany sellers have a more or less clear opinion of the price at which they want to sell the company. Naturally, they determine the price according to their subjective assessment and personal needs.\r\n\r\nWe know the market of companies sales and, therefore, based on our experience, we are able to evaluate a company. The evaluation of a company is always based on the revised earnings, i.e. the money which you as the owner will get after deducting of the financing costs.\r\n\r\nDuring the evaluation, figures are never absolute, but a value of a company is based on several aspects. It is important that you conduct such a evaluation of a company. In your opinion, what is the value of the company? There are many methods to answer such question, from a scientific approach to rules of thumb. If you feel unsure about doing such valuation on you own, consider consulting a professional, however, if possible this should not be your tax consultant. In order to exclude conflicts of interest, we can only help you with the evaluation if the seller is not our client.\r\n<h3>e) Make an offer</h3>\r\nOnce your essential questions are answered and you are still interested in buying the company, you should try to reach an agreement on the purchasing price with the seller. Usually, this is done by a non-binding offer that depends on several conditions, for example such as the in-depth examination of the core figures of the company.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for such offer is to check whether the seller will accept your suggestion of a purchase price and the according payment conditions. Do not forget that your offer is only binding if the information you received is true and if all your conditions will be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, if you have not yet come to terms regarding the financial aspects with the seller, there is no use in consulting external advisors that will make cost-intense and time-consuming examinations.\r\n<h3>f) In-depth examination (Due Diligence)</h3>\r\nOnce you have come to terms with the seller, it is time to start an in-depth examination and solve the difficulties in crucial points.\r\n<h2>What support does Business Broker AG offer?</h2>\r\nBusiness Broker AG gives you advise in connection with the purchase and the sale of companies.  We are happy to accept your mandate for a selective search of a company, for an independent company evaluation or for support in price negotiations.\r\n\r\nIn order to exclude conflicts of interest we are only able to accept your order for advise if the seller is not our client.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in one of the companies listed in our database, please contact us. We will inform you in detail about our offers and, after signing a confidentiality agreement, you will receive an extensive documentation of the company. We will take care of the entire sales process, however, we represent the sellers interests.\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\nThe decision whether you should buy a company or not or the questions if you should start your own business anyway, has to be made by yourself. It is only up to you!\r\n\r\nIn the end it depends on you if you want to take the challenge to become a successful independent business owner. This is a step you have to take on your own. Nobody can take that decision away from you. Not your tax advisor, not your broker and not your friends. It is your duty!\r\n\r\nWe are happy to invite you to contact us by phone or by e-mail in order to arrange an initial meeting.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Buyer guideline','','inherit','closed','closed','','64-revision-v1','','','2015-12-23 16:52:10','2015-12-23 16:52:10','',64,'http://7hobbits.com/64-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(168,1,'2015-12-26 14:41:06','2015-12-26 14:41:06','<h2>Addresses</h2>\r\n<article class=\"contactInfo\"><img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Location/LocationZurichBuilding_Small.jpg\" alt=\"Business Broker AG Zurich\" />Business Broker AGFlorastrasse 44CH -

We do not only determine and interpret the theoretical value of a company according to the various recognised methods, but we are also skilled in making very concrete transactions based on realisable price recommendations.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe valuation of a company is an extremely challenging task. The basis for any professional review is the revision of the figures in order to submit a satisfactory plan for future years and the meaningful application of the various recognised methods for corporate valuations.

General information on company valuation</h3>\r\nOne must basically differentiate between the theoretical value of the company and the realisable value of the company: The theoretical value of the company can be determined using various methods, each method generates different values. Therefore, there is no right or wrong theoretical value of the company, but different values, which are varyingly plausible for different viewers.\r\n\r\nThe realisable value of the company can only be established for a non-listed company if the company is actually sold. It is always a snapshot.\r\n\r\nAn assessment can be divided roughly into two types of methods: the net asset value and the income value. With the intrinsic value method, the company value is made up from the rated capacity, minus the rated debt. Here the assets can be used at book value, replacement or liquidation value. Hidden reserves must be considered accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe evaluated value of a company, it is not enough to use only the intrinsic value. The tangible assets alone do not create value, if a corresponding income is not earned. It can sometimes also be the case that with very little tangible assets one can generate a high revenue. Therefore, a company’s earning power also plays an important role in the evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe income capitalisation methods show what can be earned on the existing assets. The earning power does not include the value of intangible assets such as components of the customer base, market position and reputation. It is also determined by the company’s strategy, the market situation and the capabilities of the management.\r\n<h3>2. Reasons and occasions for a company valuation</h3>\r\nThe reasons for carrying out a business valuation are varied. In the context of a corporate sale or succession planning, the business valuation is essential for determining the price. The company valuation is also a very valuable tool for corporate governance in strategy definition and selecting alternatives. Company valuations continue to be required in legal cases as part of an expert report as well as in the establishing and distributing inheritances.\r\n<h4>2.1 Company Sale/Succession Plan</h4>\r\nAs the owner of your company decides on either a sale or succession planning, it is important to assess the site by way of a company valuation. When evaluating a company is clear what value the company has at the time of the valuation. The right arguments can be found during the price negotiation phase by means of the factors analysed. The company value is therefore the same as an argumentation value. Different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic) are taken into account during the valuation. The argumentation value shows that the calculated value is generally not equal to the eventual price to be paid. There are additional specific and subjective aspects of negotiation.\r\n<h4>2.2 Strategy definition</h4>\r\nBased on a company valuation and the resulting lessons learned, improvement measures can be established in respect of a subsequent sale of the company. Since the value drivers of the shareholder value are crystalised in a valuation, it is possible to use this to (re)align strategy. It makes sense, for example, to check the value proposition of the individual cost components. The use of personnel, premises and the tied up capital (such as machinery or vehicles) should be scrutinised and checked rigorously for possible savings. On the revenue side it is critical if the generated revenue of a business unit also has a positive impact on the overall profitability of the company or if it pushes this down.\r\n<h4>2.3 Arbitration value</h4>\r\nWhen parties are in dispute, it may be necessary to determine the arbitration value of a company. As an example, the divorce process can be named here, where there will be a dispute over the amount of the developed assets in the form of the company value. Business Broker AG has experience in the preparation of court reports and takes on the corresponding orders.\r\n<h4>2.4 Inheritance</h4>\r\nWould you like to know what the value of your business is and what value you want to leave your descendants one day, then it is essential to determine a company\'s value, which is not only theoretically correct, but can also be achieved. We will help you determine a value that is not beyond the market and based on assumptions, one that has a meaningful relationship to reality.\r\n\r\nIf you have undergone the painful experience of having lost a family member who has built up a company over the years and you (possibly jointly with other heirs) are now faced with the issue of succession, it is imperative for the parties to use a comprehensible company valuation oriented to market prices as a decision basis.\r\n<h3>3. Company valuation methods</h3>\r\nThere are a variety of company valuation methods, which as described above are divided into two basic categories: intrinsic value method and discounted earnings method. In addition, there are market value methods (multipliers, multiples), which are used for the valuation and which with other methods can make the obtained results plausible. It analyses what has already been paid in past transactions (Transaction Multiples) or what will be paid on the stock exchange for market prices (Trading Multiples). Furthermore, there are corporate policies that are theoretically correct, but not relevant in practice for SMEs, since they are simply not appropriate enough or are of too little importance or not documented enough (e.g. the valuation using the real options theory). In practice it is customary to use a valuation mix of the relevant methods. The valuation mix applied may vary industry to industry, however, it is based on the experience and the expertise of completed projects.\r\n\r\nBusiness Broker AG has extensive practical know-how, which they can draw on in each individual project valuation.\r\n<h4>3.1 Entity vs. Equity Approach</h4>\r\nTwo different perspectives and approaches can be pursued with all company valuation methods.\r\n\r\nThe entity approach takes into account the sources of income accruing to the equity investors and lenders. In other words, it is valued from the perspective of the overall company (Enterprise Value, Entity) and the gross value of the company is ascertained. If you subtract the debt, you get the net value of the company, which equals the equity. When selling a business it is the net value of the company that is relevant. This can also be derived directly from the equity approach. Only the equity holders who are entitled to sources income are capitalised. The direct derivation of the corporate value using the equity method is done, for example, in the stock assessment.\r\n<h4>3.2 Intrinsic-value method</h4>\r\nWith the intrinsic value method, all existing assets are in the balance sheet, so the assets of the company are summarised. The intrinsic value is usually calculated on going concern values (so-called reproductive values). All assets together form the total of the company’s assets and referred to as the gross asset value. To work out the net asset value of the company, i.e. the intrinsic value of equity, the debt (all debt and liabilities of the company) is deducted from the gross asset value.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"342\" />\r\n<h5>3.2.1 Book value, hidden reserves and deferred taxes</h5>\r\nThe assets in the financial accounting (balance control) represent book values and need to be revised first. The difference between the book values and the actual values includes undisclosed reserves to which the book values should be adjusted. The deferred taxes on hidden reserves can be drawn in since a positive influence is achieved on the income statement or a higher income is reported in a future release of hidden reserves. The deferred taxes can be taken into account when calculating the net asset values, in which the valuation difference (between book values and market values) is multiplied by half the tax rate and subtracted from the calculated net asset value. The use of half the tax rate takes into account, on the one hand, the subsequent collection of the taxes in time (time value of money) and, on the other hand, the scheduling of when to release the hidden reserves (the tax burden will not turn out quite so high).\r\n<h5>3.2.2 Going concern value (reproduction or replacement cost)</h5>\r\nWith the intrinsic value for the going concern value, assets are considered to be the value that they cost at today’s replacement cost at market prices. The continuation value thus indicates how much the replacement cost would be to reproduce the company. The acquisition values at current prices are used, from which the depreciation (consumption value) is deducted on grounds of age, resulting in the replacement value.\r\n<h5>3.2.3 Liquidation Value</h5>\r\nThe liquidation value is the value of the assets that can be attained after deduction of liabilities and liquidation costs. It should be noted that in a liquidation due to the tight time frame and because of the possible orientation of the assets to the purpose and the specialisation of the company, it may result in lower prices.\r\n<h5>3.2.4 Non-operational assets</h5>\r\nWhen valuing a company using the intrinsic value method, the operational assets are summed up in the first place. The company may have, however, additional non-operational assets such as real estate, which are not related to the operational activities, or there is excess liquidity that is not needed for the operation (this is not usually the case for smaller companies). These non-operational assets are to be listed separately or added in addition to the net intrinsic value and shown separately.\r\n<h5>3.2.5 Conclusion for the intrinsic value method</h5>\r\nThe intrinsic value is an inventory of existing holdings (assets), i.e. the existing matter of a company. The net intrinsic value represents the effective value of the equity, i.e. the corrected tax values of assets of the hidden reserves, minus the debts or liabilities of the company. The intrinsic value can be seen as a lower limit in the valuation of a company because tangible assets at the valuation point are physically present.\r\n<h4>3.3 Earning value methods</h4>\r\nThe earning value methods evaluate a company based on the anticipated sources of income, which the company will generate for the company owners in the future with the existing substance. The future sources of income may be in profits or cash flows. The individual earning value methods can be distinguished depending on the type of revenue. So the widespread Discounted Cash Flow method, valid as an assessment standard, is based on a cash flow factor and the pure earning value methods and also the excess profit methods to a profit factor. So-called dividend models (e.g. dividend discounting or the dividend growth model) are based on expected revenue in the form of dividends that accrue to the shareholders in the future. The dividend models are not listed here, because these are relevant for the stock assessment and also for listed companies with a constant dividend.\r\n<h5>3.3.1 Basic principles of the Earning Value Calculation</h5>\r\n<strong>3.3.1.1 Time value of the money and consideration of risks</strong>\r\nEarning value methods are all based on the same methodology: Anticipate revenue that accrues to the company owners in the future will be adjusted to the time of evaluation. The basic argument for this is the time value of money. This means that a franc is worth more today than tomorrow, as the money today can be invested at a specified interest rate (risk free market interest rate). In addition to the time value of money, the risk is taken into account, with which the returns vary in the future, what is referred to as so-called volatility. The higher the volatility, the higher the risk and therefore the cost of capital with which the time delayed revenues are discounted, i.e. are transferred to the valuation date. The cost of capital is an interest rate that considers both the temporal component mentioned, as well as the revealed risk. Discounting specifically means that a future form of income (FS) is divided by the term (1 + interest rate)<sup>period (T)</sup> to obtain the present value of the income (present value). The revenue can be profits or cash flows, which accrue at the end of each fiscal year to the company owner.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"621\" height=\"77\" />\r\n<strong>3.3.1.2 Determining the cost of capital</strong>\r\nThe amount of the capital costs has a major impact on a company\'s value, since the expected forms of revenue will be compared when evaluating the cost of capital and discounted at the WACC. The cost of capital consists of both the rates of return of equity (cost of equity) and debt capital (borrowing costs). To calculate the cost of capital, the cost of equity is weighted with the equity and debt capital costs by the percentage of debt. With the cost of debt, corporate taxes are also taken into account because the interest expenses are tax deductible. Hence the term tax-adjusted (WACC - Weighted Average Cost of Capital) is used (see Section 3.3.2 Discounted cash flow method). Equity is the most expensive capital. The required rate of return of the equity investors is much higher than the borrowing rate. By borrowing funds (for example in the form of a bank loan), the total capital costs are reduced, thereby changing the financing structure (it is the so-called financial leverage effect).\r\n\r\nThe required rate of equity can be determined using the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model). Here a risk premium and, where appropriate, risk increases for the limited tradability (for listed companies) and the size (at small and medium-sized, unlisted companies) are added to a rate perceived as being without risk (e.g. 10-year Swiss government bond). The risk premium is derived from the product of the equity beta ß<sub>EK</sub> and the market risk premium or market returns. The equity beta beta ß<sub>EK</sub> indicates how much the stock price fluctuates compared to the market (e.g. in Switzerland SMI or SPI). The empirical determination of the equity beta ß<sub>EK</sub>implies a stock market listing. Since each company has a different funding structure and capital structure, this must be taken into account when calculating the beta. This is done with the so-called Hamada\'s formula, which transforms the beta values ß<sub>GK</sub> of the Stock Exchange (this refers only to the business risk) into the ß<sub>EK</sub>, which in addition to financial risk even incorporate the company-specific financial risk. For unlisted companies, determining the cost of equity is more difficult because there are no empirical data on market beta derivation. In determining the betas, only the experience of past transactions, especially in the field of small and medium companies, plays a very important role. In addition, comparative values of publicly traded companies in the same industry can be used.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"546\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.2 Discounted Cash Flow Method</h5>\r\nThe discounted cash flow method (DCF) is, as the name suggests, a cash flow-based company valuation method. First, the costs incurred in the future, so-called free cash flows are derived or predicted, and then using the tax-adjusted average cost of capital WACC<sub>s</sub> discounted at the valuation date.\r\n\r\n<strong>3.3.2.1 Calculation of Free Cash Flows (FCF)</strong>\r\nFree cash flow estimates the cash flow from business operations, which, after investment in net operating working capital and fixed assets into the company\'s owners are, so to speak, freely available.\r\n\r\nFree Cash Flow at Entity Level is derived as follows:\r\n<p class=\"paraBorder\">EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes)\r\n- Taxes on EBIT\r\n= NOPAT (Net operating profit after taxes)\r\n+ Depreciation on intangible assets\r\n+ Amortisation of intangible assets\r\n- Changes in Net Working Capital\r\n- Capital Expenditures (Capex)\r\n- Changes in Goodwill\r\n<strong>= Unlevered Free Cash Flow</strong></p>\r\nThe DCF method according to the entity approach is considered as Best Practice, whereby the free cash flows are discounted to entity level with the tax-adjusted average cost of capital WACC<sub>s</sub>. The tax adjustment with the WACC is necessary because in the calculation of free cash flow, taxes are directly deducted from EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). This is theoretically incorrect because the borrowing costs are tax deductible and so taxes must not be subtracted directly from the EBIT, but from the EBT (earnings before taxes) - (disclosure of too high taxes). Since in practice it is difficult, however, to predict the exact applicable taxes, the \"incorrectness\" mentioned in the WACC<sub>s</sub> is taken into account, so when determining the cost of debt, the taxes are incorporated and so the taxes that have been estimated too high are corrected again.\r\n\r\nAn income statement plan is drawn up for the next 4-5 years, starting from a valuation point. A simplified scenario is worked with for the time periods after the 4-5 years. A so-called residual value is determined. Here, the assumption is made that the investment currently meets the depreciation, so that the free cash flow to be discounted on a straight agrees on the entity level with the NOPAT (Net Operating Profit after Taxes). The gross value of the company consists of the actuarial value of free cash flow at the Entity level together with the cash value of the residual value.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the net value of the company, the value of equity, the net debt is subtracted from the company\'s gross value.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"456\" />\r\n<strong>3.3.2.2 Residual value, planning horizon, eternal growth</strong>\r\nThe difficulty in defining the planning horizon is the weighting of the residual value. The greater the number of planning years, the more difficult it is to plan the future free cash flows, because the quantity of the residual value is smaller than the value of the company. It therefore makes sense to forecast only about 4-5 years, as these are justifiable and understandable, and therefore accept a higher proportion of the residual value at the company\'s value.\r\n\r\nIn the planning of future profits or free cash flows one can make the assumption that profits should have an eternal growth after the planning horizon. In the denominator of the DCF formula, the growth rate g is then subtracted from the WACC<sub>s</sub>. The assumption of perpetual growth NOPAT is a very strong statement and must be viewed with great caution and above all provided with a reasonable and founded justification.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.3 Pure earning value method</h5>\r\nAside from a detailed planning of the future years, one can perform a simplified earning value calculation. Here it is assumed that a perpetual profit (before interest payments) can be achieved and this profit corresponds as the equivalent to the free cash flow entity. This stems from the fact that there are no changes in working capital and that investments just meet the depreciation, which implies that only replacement investments will be made. The resulting profit is regarded as eternal and is hereby discounted with the non-tax adjusted WACC in this case, because the taxes in the calculation of EBIT (earnings before interest) are calculated correctly.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel07.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"208\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.4 Goodwill</h5>\r\nThe difference between the revenue value and the intrinsic value is called goodwill. Goodwill describes part of the purchase price, which is paid in addition to the value of the material elements of capital, for the customer base, reputation, brand, market position, access to the work performance of employees and for other intangible assets. The amount of goodwill sometimes depends on the industry sector. If a company sells a capital intensive business, the goodwill in relation to the sales price is considerably lower than in a pure service company, where there are tangible assets.\r\n<h5>3.3.5 Average value method (Mean value method)</h5>\r\nThe average method involves a weighted averaging of asset and revenue value.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel08.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"367\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.6 Excess profit methods</h5>\r\nThe intrinsic value method and the discounted cash flow method can be connected with each other using the excess profit process. Here recoverable excess profit is added to the gross asset value over a certain period T. The excess profit is the difference between the budgeted profit before tax (earnings before interest) and the normal profit, which is the product of asset value and the non-tax-adjusted cost of capital (WACC). The budgeted profit can be higher than normal profit, for example due to a strong market position, due to competitive advantages, but it is time limited. The excess profit adopted for a certain period is capitalised with the present value annuity factor, composed as in the following formula:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"484\" />\r\n<h4>3.4 Market Value Method (multipliers, multiples)</h4>\r\nThe corporate value can be determined with publicly listed companies by the prices paid on the stock exchange (trading multiples) or compared with the acquisitions, transaction prices (Transaction multiples) already paid for by the company. Trading multiples and transaction multiples are summarised under the term of market multiples (multipliers). Important Market multiples are revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, net profit multiple, the price-earnings ratio (PER or P/E ratio) or the Market-to-book ratio, where the multiples are always a multiple of the listed figures. With unlisted companies a comparison is made with prices paid on the stock market, however, proven to be relatively difficult. A comparison may be of use when establishing a price range.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"361\" />\r\nIn the multiple-evaluation it is important that it starts from the same base. Either one rates at the corporate level (enterprise value, gross, unlevered) or at the equity level (equity value, net, levered). It is also useful to form an average of the individual multiples, so as to balance a possible bias or offset. Moreover, it makes sense to form an average over several years for each included Multiple.\r\n<h4>3.5 Ownership profit (EBITDA)</h4>\r\nParticular attention is given to the important EBITDA Multiple. EBITDA stands for <i>Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation (fixed assets) and amortisation (on intangible assets)</i>. This represents an important tool in corporate valuation especially for small and medium-sized companies. This multiplier is from the financing structure and influenced by the state of the investment cycle and therefore one of the most meaningful multipliers. A company that has just invested finds itself confronted with higher depreciation and a lower profit than a company that has made no investments over time.\r\n\r\nThe owner of earnings based on the EBITDA represents the actual cash flow generated, adjusted to reflect corrections and before depreciation. If one adds the gross salary (including benefits) to the EBITDA that the owner of the company has paid out to himself, this results in the owner earnings (EBITDA level). Multiplied by a certain factor, this represents a fundamental price indicator in particular regarding the evaluation of the profitability of small and medium-sized companies, which a DCF valuation may not make much sense. The origin of the term: owner’s profit (EBITDA), owner’s cash flows come from the Anglo-American term. Usually the owners themselves are active in the company and will benefit from various services provided by the company for him. In relation to an employee he would have to finance for such benefits for himself from his work income.\r\n\r\nThe starting point for calculating the owner’s profit at EBITDA level is always the EBITDA according to the financial statements. To which the following adjustments or corrections are to be made:\r\n<div class=\"divBorder\">\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>EBITDA according to the financial statements</strong></li>\r\n	<li>Addition of the gross salary of the owner or owners (including bonuses, bonuses and benefits)</li>\r\n	<li>Addition of additional charges which are not included in the gross wage</li>\r\n	<li>One-off addition/subtraction, non-recurring expenses/revenues, which were debited/credited to the P&amp;L account</li>\r\n	<li>Addition/subtraction income/expenses not operationally required, which were debited/credited to the P&amp;L account</li>\r\n	<li>Addition/subtraction of income/expenses of a private nature, which were billed to the business</li>\r\n	<li>Addition/Subtraction formation/release of hidden reserves</li>\r\n	<li>Addition of easily and quickly realisable savings</li>\r\n	<li><strong>= owner’s profit at EBITDA level</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\nWith over 100 sales of companies in the past four years, Business Broker AG has built up a very valuable database in terms of multiples, which are actually paid in the area of small and medium sized companies. Of course, this requires a prior revision of the financial statements as listed above.\r\n<h3>4. Procedure during a company valuation</h3>\r\nTo perform a meaningful due diligence, regardless of the method chosen, some key steps are to be considered:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Revision of the financial statements</li>\r\n	<li>Business valuation with a method mix</li>\r\n	<li>Comparison and interpretation of results</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>4.1 The revision of financial statements</h4>\r\nThe balance sheets and income statements for the past 3 years must be revised for non-operating, and extraordinary personal income and expenses or assets and liabilities. Examples of this can also include rented business premises, which are shown as an expense in the P&amp;L account, but are not required for the business activities. Or the owner runs an expensive car and pays for its leasing costs through the business. These additional expenditures are to be neutralised or taken out.\r\n<h4>4.2 Company valuation Method mix</h4>\r\nThe presentation and selection of assessment methods always gives rise to discussions. First, it should be noted that a company valuation method is limited to its own explanatory power. In our experience, the mix of company valuation methods has proven successful. The intrinsic value can be regarded as a lower limit in the definition of a bandwidth value. Thereafter, the earning value is determined using the discounted cash flow method and is weighted and combined together with the earning value discussed by multiples, which is already a temporal and methodological average, according to the average value method (this is often the mean value method). So we combine the discounted cash flow method with our extensive knowledge from existing transactions (Transaction multiples).\r\n<h4>4.3 Comparison and interpretation of the results</h4>\r\n<h5>4.3.1 Plausibility check</h5>\r\nThe plausibility of the valuation results can be done with technically simple valuation methods, like the pure income capitalisation method is. This makes sense particularly with the discounted cash flow method, in which the cost of capital, the planning figures and the residual value represent particularly value-sensitive factors, this makes sense. Furthermore, plausibility checks can be made with multiples. Crucial to the plausibility test, however, is the experience of the consultant from other projects. An experienced consultant can use his knowledge of the existing company valuations that come from different industries and are characterised by a variety of company-specific traits, for profit. He has developed over time a practical and goal-oriented perspective and is able to assess very carefully whether it makes sense to determine company value and apply a mix of methods or not.\r\n\r\nWith a company valuation, assumptions are made regarding the sales development and also the development of costs (staff costs, material costs, other operating expenses). In addition, with the earning value method, a certain cost of capital is set and used for discounting the flow of revenue. As the future is uncertain, it makes sense to work with different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic), especially with regard to the sales of a company, which may depend in particular on the industry or market development, and with respect to different levels of capital cost percentages (company-specific risks). With the change in the cost of capital, it is easy to see how sensitively the earning value reacts.\r\n<h5>4.3.2 Traceability</h5>\r\nIt is essential that the assumptions are critically analysed, especially with the earning value methods (specially the DCF method). One deals intensively with the company\'s business model and value factors, which responds sensitively to an assessment. It is not done with a purely technical valuation on the basis of a business plan or planning figures (plan P&amp;L statements, projected balance sheets, schedule of cash flows). The assumptions must be readily comprehensible, so that an outsider sees and also understands the most important value driver on the valuation of a business.\r\n<h3>5. Conclusion</h3>\r\nThe company valuation is not about finding the absolutely correct value. Company values do not represent pure objective values, instead they are based on many subjective assumptions. The point is to determine a value bandwidth, which can be used for plausibility and communication purposes. The bandwidth value of the earning value comes from the fact that different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic) and various other assumptions are made. The income/cost development is evaluated and so are the business and financial risks of the company and the industry development of different variants. A lower limit is determined based on the intrinsic value that is physically present and which varies depending on the capital intensity of operations. Depending on the scenario, then the return value and the goodwill to be attained are specified as the difference between the earning and net asset value. All the results obtained in the context of a company valuation require expert assessment and a plausibility check. Only those who can see the value driving factors and an assessment of the underlying assumptions in detail, will be in a position to interpret the calculated value of the company.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div class=\"callToAction_button\"><a class=\"callToAction_buttonText\" href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></div>\r\n<span class=\"callToAction_text\">Ask for our no-obligation information pack:</span>','Valuation methods','','inherit','closed','closed','','80-revision-v1','','','2016-01-06 12:02:15','2016-01-06 12:02:15','',80,'http://startupbroker.gr/80-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(201,1,'2016-01-06 12:05:07','2016-01-06 12:05:07','<h1>Succession Advice</h1>\r\n<strong>Business Broker AG has already supported more than 300 successions.

I also found it expensive. Preparing company presentations by using the figures from the annual report was very interesting. After I had given you the mandate I found the total support and the quick sale very agreeable. Now, after the sale, I have to say that I have been very satisfied with your work. Thanks again.\n\n<cite>Mr. P. Gutenberg, ex Bakrona Zurich AG</cite></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Thank you very much for your help and your big effort. Of course I will recommend Start Up Broker LC whenever I can.  It is still difficult to say but I am looking forward to the next cooperation, you never know.\n\n<cite>Ercole Fusco, ex Fusco Plumbing GmbH</cite></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Working together with Start Up Broker LC was always a pleasure. The reception was very courteous, the execution of the work professional and quick. What I appreciated were the clear understandings which Mr. Schubert repeated after each meeting, so that everyone knew exactly what was meant. The strategies for the sale of my company were supported by a tightly led web portal, the presentation of which shows many years\' experience and is set up in a contemporary manner. Discretion was always a top priority; every interested party was bound to observe confidentiality. During the negotiations Mr. Schubert had the necessary calmness, which almost everyone in the position of selling their company is lacking. Also, a high level of know how is a very important factor which Start Up Broker LC have. I can therefore only recommend engaging the services of Start Up Broker LC when selling companies and for succession planning.\nI am convinced that success is not only achieved through ideas, strategies, goal settings and figures, it requires a human being who is also emotionally involved. Emotional decisions are the strength which is in us and which needs to be considered just as much as intelligence. From my point of view I have been able to experience this combination from Start Up Broker LC. It also touched me, that when I collected my documents after the sale, the team came together to congratulate me on my success. I felt happy after each visit; it also had something glorious about it because I was one step closer to my success. I would like to thank everyone for the exciting and wonderful time.\n\n<cite>Markus Anderegg, ex AM Caretaker</cite></blockquote>\n<blockquote>I wish you much success with selling.

Niederberger, ex Londonhouse</cite></blockquote>\n<blockquote>No matter how it will develop, we have to thank you very much. We have been independent for almost two decades and we have experienced quite a lot. Your efficiency, paired with understanding and friendliness, is unique.\nContinue to work like this. We will make it up to you by referring as many as possible independent company owners wanting to sell to you.

The basis for any professional review is the revision of the figures in order to submit a satisfactory plan for future years and the meaningful application of the various recognized methods for corporate valuations. Each method provides different values – a valuation is of little use without a professional interpretation of individual results and the knowledge of realized projects.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for a company valuation are numerous.Start Up Broker LC prepares company valuations in the context of:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Succession Planning</li>\r\n	<li>Corporate sales</li>\r\n	<li>Strategy Definition</li>\r\n	<li>Court reports</li>\r\n	<li>Separations</li>\r\n	<li>Provision / distribution of an inheritance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you do not just want to know what your business is worth in theory, but also what price can be achieved in the market, then do not hesitate to contact us.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Request our unbinding info package at</dt><dd><a href=\"/contact/\">Contact us</a></dd></dl>','Company valuation','','inherit','closed','closed','','42-revision-v1','','','2016-01-20 14:29:49','2016-01-20 14:29:49','',42,'http://startupbroker.gr/42-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(281,1,'2016-01-20 14:30:32','2016-01-20 14:30:32','<h1>Succession Advice</h1>\r\n<strong>Start Up Broker LC has already supported more than 300 successions.

We are in an environment in which the survival rate for young companies is obviously overestimated. This shocking statistic is based on three factors that new entrepreneurs are often overlooked: Poor location and / or poor product, insufficient capitalization and excessive demands.\r\n\r\nAnyone starting a business, usually prepares meticulously at the start and creates a detailed business plan – one would assume. Studies show that the higher the means needed for a start-up, the greater the chance of survival - the more financial resources required, the more time is spent in preparation. These types of business are not established as often, but they survive more often.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the start-up companies, about 110,000 businesses in Europe are passed on or sold to a successor each year. This provides many opportunities for individuals who want to start their own.\r\n\r\nThe chances of success in corporate purchasing as opposed to starting up is better in many cases: The buyer of an existing company can assume that the owner of the company has chosen the right location and included the appropriate products in his portfolio, otherwise the company would have stopped operating long ago. To overcome the last hurdle - the excessive demands - the majority of business owners have at their disposal the new owner with advice and assistance.\r\n\r\nWhen a company is being set up, the use of financial resources is often underestimated, this is much less the case when buying. The demand for liquidity can be estimated much better. In addition, the buyer already achieves the first turnover on the day he takes over and he has the sales history from the past. The risk of overly optimistic revenue and profit margin forecast is significantly lowered.\r\n\r\nEven with a purchase there is still the entrepreneurial risk. Buying, however, is a promising alternative to starting up.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Buy a company instead of founding a new one','','inherit','closed','closed','','60-revision-v1','','','2016-01-20 14:52:40','2016-01-20 14:52:40','',60,'http://startupbroker.gr/60-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(296,1,'2016-01-20 14:56:19','2016-01-20 14:56:19','<h1>Guideline for buyers</h1>\n\nWe have drawn up a short guideline for private persons, which offers a first introduction to issues in connection with the purchase of a company.\n\nAre you planning to buy your own company?

Check whether a company suits your talents, your capacities and your lifestyle. However, please do not forget that the perfect company does not exist. First and foremost, you will be taking a big step: as a business owner, you are in charge.\n\nPlease take the time to work through the guideline and to answer the questions for yourself. This will help you to sort out your targets and your motivation, your financial and your personal starting point:\n<ol>\n	<li>A business owner is called a business owner because he/she does business!</li>\n	<li>Important questions to be considered and answered previous to the purchase\n<ol>\n	<li>Establish or purchase a company</li>\n	<li>What should you pay attention to when buying a company?</li>\n	<li>Why do you wish to buy a company?</li>\n	<li>What is your time frame to find the right company?</li>\n	<li>Are you willing to invest an important part of your financial funds into a company?</li>\n	<li>Are you sufficiently independent to take decisions by yourself?</li>\n	<li>Is your family supporting you as a business owner?</li>\n	<li>Are you open in your search or are you looking for a specific kind of company?</li>\n	<li>Do you have appropriate expectations?</li>\n	<li>Do you need security?</li>\n	<li>How do you define success?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n	<li>The purchase process</li>\n	<li>How does a broker help you?</li>\n	<li>Do you need a lawyer?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>A business owner is called a business owner because he/she does business</h2>\nTo buy a company is a major step and a challenge for which you have to overcome your fears and concerns. Almost 90% of the people, who purchase a company have never been the manager of a company before. A person who always wants to be on the safe side should never start their own business.\n\nWhen you start your search, you should consider that being a business owner is more than just a job. It means a change of lifestyle. Very often, such a change is considerable: normally you work longer hours, you have to make all decisions by yourself and you need to be willing to do all kinds of jobs. In other words: you are responsible for all kinds of work necessary for the success of a company and to keep it going. In reality, this means you have to wipe the floor or change a light bulb yourself.\n\nWhat are the reasons for a private person to become a business owner?\n<ul>\n	<li>Take your destiny in your hands</li>\n	<li>Proud of service or product</li>\n	<li>Flexibility</li>\n	<li>Financial opportunities</li>\n	<li>Recognition</li>\n	<li>Safety</li>\n	<li>Privacy</li>\n	<li>Status</li>\n	<li>Contact with clients and staff</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Important questions which should be considered and answered previous to the purchase of a company</h2>\n<h3>a) Establish or purchase a company?</h3>\nApproximately 50% of all cases of insolvency occur during the first four years after the foundation of a company. This alarming statistic shows that people often do not consider three important factors before they establish a company: bad location and/or poor quality of a product, insufficient financial reserves and, last but not least, they are overwhelmed by demands.\n\nWhen taking over an already existing business you can be sure that the location that the founder of the company had chosen is good and that the right products are in the portfolio, otherwise the company would not have existed for a long time. In order to manage the third point, being overwhelmed by the demands, it is advisable to accept the help of the former company owner.  Most business owners are willing to support the new owner on their way to a successful business independency.\n<h3>b) What you should pay attention to when purchasing a company?</h3>\nUnfortunately, the initial question of many potential buyers is the price of a company and only as a second thought they consider what can be earned from it.\n\nImportant is the question, how much capital you need in order to finance the purchase price. However, there is no point in considering a purchase of a company if the requested amount of funds is higher than what you are able to finance.\n\nBuy a company, which you find easy to identify with. Being a proud business owner is an essential ingredient for success. On the other hand, the firm shall generate sufficient earnings in order to guarantee the coverage of your cost of living as well as the financial costs.\n\nLast but not least, consider the potential of a company, which may still be conceiled. What can be improved to make the company more profitable? A saying goes: \"Don\'t buy a company that cannot  be improved!\"\n<h3>c) Why do you wish to buy a company?</h3>\nIf you are not really motivated to buy a company, let it be. You must be entirely committed to become a business owner and this includes the right motivation. Being a business owner still is the basis of the \"great American dream\", but this does not mean that it is everybody\'s dream.\n\nIf working in a large organisation does not satisfy you anymore, going to work everyday only means earning money to you or if you have a job without any perspectives, then being independent may be the right option for you.\n<h3>d) What time-frame do you have to find the suitable company?</h3>\nIf you consider purchasing a company in two years you should start to gather the necessary information already now. However, there is no point in starting to search the right company now. Each company you find today is ready to be sold immediately.\n<h3>e) Are you willing to invest the most important part of your capital into a new company?</h3>\nThe purchase of an own company is an important financial investment. If you are a person that does not want to run any risks, also from a financial point of view, you should reconsider your decision to purchase an own company.\n<h3>f) Are you sufficiently independent to take all your decisions by yourself?</h3>\nIf you run a small business, you have to take many decisions. You are the boss and you are responsible. All decisions are your decisions, whether they are wrong or right. You will take wrong decisions for which you must bear the consequences. Are you able to cope with such a situation and do you have the strength to continue after such a failure? If you are constantly concerned and will have sleepless nights, an own company may not be the ideal option for you.\n<h3>g) Is your family supporting you as a business owner?</h3>\nIf your family, especially your partner, does not entirely agree with your decision, you should reconsider becoming a business owner. It is mandatory that your partner supports you. He or she has to know that being the owner of a company is very time-consuming. On the other hand, being your own boss means very often that your working hours are more flexible and offers the possibility once in a while to enjoy a free afternoon with your family.\n<h3>h) Are you open in your search or are you looking for a specific kind of company?</h3>\nIf you consider buying a company, it is advisable to be open to any kind of opportunity. There are many different companies and you should not narrow down your choice. Watch out for a company that guarantees you the income that you need (or at least the opportunity to do so), a company that you are able to finance and, last but not least, a company which offers opportunities to be successful by working hard.\n<h3>i) Are your expectations appropriate?</h3>\nIt is important that you keep your feet on the ground when defining your expectations. Many owners have built up their business over many years, have invested time and energy and it often represents their entire fortune. Many sellers will be willing to support you financially for the purchase of the company, however, they will not give you any presents.\n<h3>j) Do you need security?</h3>\nIf you need security, being a business owner is not the right option for you. Even if you examine all books and documents, you can never be sure since such figures are from the past. A new owner always brings changes along, no matter how small such changes are.  Everyone has a different way of managing a company and times change fast. Consider a company under the aspect of its potential for improvement. Naturally, a company\'s past financial data is important, however it does not give any guarantee for the future. You are the guarantee!\n<h3>k) What is the secret of success?</h3>\nIt is essential that you have enough financial assets to buy the company of your dreams and to be able to make the necessary amendments. As the starting phase may be difficult, you should be in possession of sufficient financial reserves.\n\nHowever, being successful or not depends also on factors that you are able to influence in a significant way: Your willingness to work hard and long hours especially in the beginning. Successful business owners claim to be at the same time secretary, vendor, bookkeeper and manager. That is exactly the attitude that will lead you to success! Think of not only being a \"planer\" - think of being a \"doer\"!\n<h2>Purchase process</h2>\nHow does one buy a company? There is no right or wrong way to do it. The important thing is that you get answers to all your questions and that the information, which is necessary, is available in order to help you to make the right decisions.\n\nThe following illustrates the usual process:\n<h3>a) Gathering of essential facts and figures</h3>\nIn the beginning, get information on prices, conditions, earnings, revised earnings and the general situation. For all companies for sale Start Up Broker LC draws up a short company description in which you will find the most important information.\n<h3>b) Visit the company</h3>\nIn order to check whether you like the location and the visual appearance, go and visit the company as a client. It would be too early to have a discussion with the owner. If it is unusual or difficult to visit the company as a client, then arrange a meeting with the seller.\n<h3>c) Insist on answers to your questions</h3>\nIf you like the company you should start trying to get answers to your questions. For example: What is the cost for the rent? For how many more years does the tenancy agreement run? How high was the turnover during the last few years? Is the seller in possession of figures, which prove his statements? At that moment it is not yet necessary to examine in detail the seller\'s books. At a later stage, there will be enough time for such an examination by means of a due diligence. It is now first and foremost important to get the answers that will influence your decision whether to buy the company or not.\n\nWhat you should pay attention to:\n<ol>\n	<li>How long does the company exist already?Normally, if a company has existed for a long period of time, this confirms that such company is profitable. It is not without reason that this firm has been on the market for many years. It shows that the owner had chosen the right location and the right product.</li>\n	<li>How long has the current owner been in charge?An essential criterion for your decision to buy is information about the current owner. As a rule, the longer a company was in possession of the same owner, the more successful a company is. Nobody keeps a company if one does not earn money on it.</li>\n	<li>For what reason is the owner selling the company?This is a very important question! The actual reason for the sale will influence the seller\'s flexibility regarding the purchase price and the conditions of payment. If an owner has taken over the firm only six month ago and claims to want to retire now, you should get sceptical. However, do not forget that business people often get tired of a branch after a certain period of time and start to look for a new challenge. The question of the reason for the selling is very important, therefore, you should insist on an answer.</li>\n	<li>Profit and Loss account of small and mid-sized companiesLike any private person, companies try to pay as few taxes as possible. Accordingly, many expenses in the books are private expenses of the owner. It is worthwhile to have a closer look at the various expenses (costs for vehicles, travel expenses, expenses for representational activities, etc.). For example, the trip to Southern France, was it really a business trip? The company car, does it serve only for business purposes? We will support you in order to get these questions answered.\n\nHowever, when doing such research, please do not forget that all and any figures relate to the past. There is no guarantee what the future will bring. What kind of policy for expenses will you implement when owning the businesses? To what turnover will your ideas and your hard work lead? The company\'s future is in your hands!</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>d) Evaluate the company</h3>\nMany sellers have a more or less clear opinion of the price at which they want to sell the company. Naturally, they determine the price according to their subjective assessment and personal needs.\n\nWe know the market of companies sales and, therefore, based on our experience, we are able to evaluate a company. The evaluation of a company is always based on the revised earnings, i.e. the money which you as the owner will get after deducting of the financing costs.\n\nDuring the evaluation, figures are never absolute, but a value of a company is based on several aspects. It is important that you conduct such a evaluation of a company. In your opinion, what is the value of the company? There are many methods to answer such question, from a scientific approach to rules of thumb. If you feel unsure about doing such valuation on you own, consider consulting a professional, however, if possible this should not be your tax consultant. In order to exclude conflicts of interest, we can only help you with the evaluation if the seller is not our client.\n<h3>e) Make an offer</h3>\nOnce your essential questions are answered and you are still interested in buying the company, you should try to reach an agreement on the purchasing price with the seller. Usually, this is done by a non-binding offer that depends on several conditions, for example such as the in-depth examination of the core figures of the company.\n\nThe main reason for such offer is to check whether the seller will accept your suggestion of a purchase price and the according payment conditions. Do not forget that your offer is only binding if the information you received is true and if all your conditions will be fulfilled.\n\nAt this stage, if you have not yet come to terms regarding the financial aspects with the seller, there is no use in consulting external advisors that will make cost-intense and time-consuming examinations.\n<h3>f) In-depth examination (Due Diligence)</h3>\nOnce you have come to terms with the seller, it is time to start an in-depth examination and solve the difficulties in crucial points.\n<h2>What support does Start Up Broker LC offer?</h2>\nStart Up Broker LC gives you advise in connection with the purchase and the sale of companies.  We are happy to accept your mandate for a selective search of a company, for an independent company evaluation or for support in price negotiations.\n\nIn order to exclude conflicts of interest we are only able to accept your order for advise if the seller is not our client.\n\nIf you are interested in one of the companies listed in our database, please contact us. We will inform you in detail about our offers and, after signing a confidentiality agreement, you will receive an extensive documentation of the company. We will take care of the entire sales process, however, we represent the sellers interests.\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\nThe decision whether you should buy a company or not or the questions if you should start your own business anyway, has to be made by yourself. It is only up to you!\n\nIn the end it depends on you if you want to take the challenge to become a successful independent business owner. This is a step you have to take on your own. Nobody can take that decision away from you. Not your tax advisor, not your broker and not your friends. It is your duty!\n\nWe are happy to invite you to contact us by phone or by e-mail in order to arrange an initial meeting.\n\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Buyer guideline','','inherit','closed','closed','','64-autosave-v1','','','2016-01-20 14:56:19','2016-01-20 14:56:19','',64,'http://startupbroker.gr/64-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(297,1,'2016-01-20 14:57:46','2016-01-20 14:57:46','<h1>Guideline for buyers</h1>\r\n\r\nWe have drawn up a short guideline for private persons, which offers a first introduction to issues in connection with the purchase of a company.\r\n\r\nAre you planning to buy your own company?

In order to manage the third point, being overwhelmed by the demands, it is advisable to accept the help of the former company owner.  Most business owners are willing to support the new owner on their way to a successful business independency.\r\n<h3>b) What you should pay attention to when purchasing a company?</h3>\r\nUnfortunately, the initial question of many potential buyers is the price of a company and only as a second thought they consider what can be earned from it.\r\n\r\nImportant is the question, how much capital you need in order to finance the purchase price. However, there is no point in considering a purchase of a company if the requested amount of funds is higher than what you are able to finance.\r\n\r\nBuy a company, which you find easy to identify with. Being a proud business owner is an essential ingredient for success. On the other hand, the firm shall generate sufficient earnings in order to guarantee the coverage of your cost of living as well as the financial costs.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, consider the potential of a company, which may still be conceiled. What can be improved to make the company more profitable? A saying goes: \"Don\'t buy a company that cannot  be improved!\"\r\n<h3>c) Why do you wish to buy a company?</h3>\r\nIf you are not really motivated to buy a company, let it be. You must be entirely committed to become a business owner and this includes the right motivation. Being a business owner still is the basis of the \"great American dream\", but this does not mean that it is everybody\'s dream.\r\n\r\nIf working in a large organisation does not satisfy you anymore, going to work everyday only means earning money to you or if you have a job without any perspectives, then being independent may be the right option for you.\r\n<h3>d) What time-frame do you have to find the suitable company?</h3>\r\nIf you consider purchasing a company in two years you should start to gather the necessary information already now. However, there is no point in starting to search the right company now. Each company you find today is ready to be sold immediately.\r\n<h3>e) Are you willing to invest the most important part of your capital into a new company?</h3>\r\nThe purchase of an own company is an important financial investment. If you are a person that does not want to run any risks, also from a financial point of view, you should reconsider your decision to purchase an own company.\r\n<h3>f) Are you sufficiently independent to take all your decisions by yourself?</h3>\r\nIf you run a small business, you have to take many decisions. You are the boss and you are responsible. All decisions are your decisions, whether they are wrong or right. You will take wrong decisions for which you must bear the consequences. Are you able to cope with such a situation and do you have the strength to continue after such a failure? If you are constantly concerned and will have sleepless nights, an own company may not be the ideal option for you.\r\n<h3>g) Is your family supporting you as a business owner?</h3>\r\nIf your family, especially your partner, does not entirely agree with your decision, you should reconsider becoming a business owner. It is mandatory that your partner supports you. He or she has to know that being the owner of a company is very time-consuming. On the other hand, being your own boss means very often that your working hours are more flexible and offers the possibility once in a while to enjoy a free afternoon with your family.\r\n<h3>h) Are you open in your search or are you looking for a specific kind of company?</h3>\r\nIf you consider buying a company, it is advisable to be open to any kind of opportunity. There are many different companies and you should not narrow down your choice. Watch out for a company that guarantees you the income that you need (or at least the opportunity to do so), a company that you are able to finance and, last but not least, a company which offers opportunities to be successful by working hard.\r\n<h3>i) Are your expectations appropriate?</h3>\r\nIt is important that you keep your feet on the ground when defining your expectations. Many owners have built up their business over many years, have invested time and energy and it often represents their entire fortune. Many sellers will be willing to support you financially for the purchase of the company, however, they will not give you any presents.\r\n<h3>j) Do you need security?</h3>\r\nIf you need security, being a business owner is not the right option for you. Even if you examine all books and documents, you can never be sure since such figures are from the past. A new owner always brings changes along, no matter how small such changes are.  Everyone has a different way of managing a company and times change fast. Consider a company under the aspect of its potential for improvement. Naturally, a company\'s past financial data is important, however it does not give any guarantee for the future. You are the guarantee!\r\n<h3>k) What is the secret of success?</h3>\r\nIt is essential that you have enough financial assets to buy the company of your dreams and to be able to make the necessary amendments. As the starting phase may be difficult, you should be in possession of sufficient financial reserves.\r\n\r\nHowever, being successful or not depends also on factors that you are able to influence in a significant way: Your willingness to work hard and long hours especially in the beginning. Successful business owners claim to be at the same time secretary, vendor, bookkeeper and manager. That is exactly the attitude that will lead you to success! Think of not only being a \"planer\" - think of being a \"doer\"!\r\n<h2>Purchase process</h2>\r\nHow does one buy a company? There is no right or wrong way to do it. The important thing is that you get answers to all your questions and that the information, which is necessary, is available in order to help you to make the right decisions.\r\n\r\nThe following illustrates the usual process:\r\n<h3>a) Gathering of essential facts and figures</h3>\r\nIn the beginning, get information on prices, conditions, earnings, revised earnings and the general situation. For all companies for sale Start Up Broker LC draws up a short company description in which you will find the most important information.\r\n<h3>b) Visit the company</h3>\r\nIn order to check whether you like the location and the visual appearance, go and visit the company as a client. It would be too early to have a discussion with the owner. If it is unusual or difficult to visit the company as a client, then arrange a meeting with the seller.\r\n<h3>c) Insist on answers to your questions</h3>\r\nIf you like the company you should start trying to get answers to your questions. For example: What is the cost for the rent? For how many more years does the tenancy agreement run? How high was the turnover during the last few years? Is the seller in possession of figures, which prove his statements? At that moment it is not yet necessary to examine in detail the seller\'s books. At a later stage, there will be enough time for such an examination by means of a due diligence. It is now first and foremost important to get the answers that will influence your decision whether to buy the company or not.\r\n\r\nWhat you should pay attention to:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How long does the company exist already?Normally, if a company has existed for a long period of time, this confirms that such company is profitable. It is not without reason that this firm has been on the market for many years. It shows that the owner had chosen the right location and the right product.</li>\r\n	<li>How long has the current owner been in charge?An essential criterion for your decision to buy is information about the current owner. As a rule, the longer a company was in possession of the same owner, the more successful a company is. Nobody keeps a company if one does not earn money on it.</li>\r\n	<li>For what reason is the owner selling the company?This is a very important question! The actual reason for the sale will influence the seller\'s flexibility regarding the purchase price and the conditions of payment. If an owner has taken over the firm only six month ago and claims to want to retire now, you should get skeptical. However, do not forget that business people often get tired of a branch after a certain period of time and start to look for a new challenge. The question of the reason for the selling is very important, therefore, you should insist on an answer.</li>\r\n	<li>Profit and Loss account of small and mid-sized companies. Like any private person, companies try to pay as few taxes as possible. Accordingly, many expenses in the books are private expenses of the owner. It is worthwhile to have a closer look at the various expenses (costs for vehicles, travel expenses, expenses for representational activities, etc.). For example, the trip to Southern France, was it really a business trip? The company car, does it serve only for business purposes? We will support you in order to get these questions answered.\r\n\r\nHowever, when doing such research, please do not forget that all and any figures relate to the past. There is no guarantee what the future will bring. What kind of policy for expenses will you implement when owning the businesses? To what turnover will your ideas and your hard work lead? The company\'s future is in your hands!</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>d) Evaluate the company</h3>\r\nMany sellers have a more or less clear opinion of the price at which they want to sell the company. Naturally, they determine the price according to their subjective assessment and personal needs.\r\n\r\nWe know the market of companies sales and, therefore, based on our experience, we are able to evaluate a company. The evaluation of a company is always based on the revised earnings, i.e. the money which you as the owner will get after deducting of the financing costs.\r\n\r\nDuring the evaluation, figures are never absolute, but a value of a company is based on several aspects. It is important that you conduct such a evaluation of a company. In your opinion, what is the value of the company? There are many methods to answer such question, from a scientific approach to rules of thumb. If you feel unsure about doing such valuation on you own, consider consulting a professional, however, if possible this should not be your tax consultant. In order to exclude conflicts of interest, we can only help you with the evaluation if the seller is not our client.\r\n<h3>e) Make an offer</h3>\r\nOnce your essential questions are answered and you are still interested in buying the company, you should try to reach an agreement on the purchasing price with the seller. Usually, this is done by a non-binding offer that depends on several conditions, for example such as the in-depth examination of the core figures of the company.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for such offer is to check whether the seller will accept your suggestion of a purchase price and the according payment conditions. Do not forget that your offer is only binding if the information you received is true and if all your conditions will be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, if you have not yet come to terms regarding the financial aspects with the seller, there is no use in consulting external advisors that will make cost-intense and time-consuming examinations.\r\n<h3>f) In-depth examination (Due Diligence)</h3>\r\nOnce you have come to terms with the seller, it is time to start an in-depth examination and solve the difficulties in crucial points.\r\n<h2>What support does Start Up Broker LC offer?</h2>\r\nStart Up Broker LC gives you advise in connection with the purchase and the sale of companies.  We are happy to accept your mandate for a selective search of a company, for an independent company evaluation or for support in price negotiations.\r\n\r\nIn order to exclude conflicts of interest we are only able to accept your order for advise if the seller is not our client.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in one of the companies listed in our database, please contact us. We will inform you in detail about our offers and, after signing a confidentiality agreement, you will receive an extensive documentation of the company. We will take care of the entire sales process, however, we represent the sellers interests.\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\nThe decision whether you should buy a company or not or the questions if you should start your own business anyway, has to be made by yourself. It is only up to you!\r\n\r\nIn the end it depends on you if you want to take the challenge to become a successful independent business owner. This is a step you have to take on your own. Nobody can take that decision away from you. Not your tax advisor, not your broker and not your friends. It is your duty!\r\n\r\nWe are happy to invite you to contact us by phone or by e-mail in order to arrange an initial meeting.\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"callToAction\"><dt>Ask for our no-obligation information pack</dt><dd><a href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></dd></dl>','Buyer guideline','','inherit','closed','closed','','64-revision-v1','','','2016-01-20 14:57:46','2016-01-20 14:57:46','',64,'http://startupbroker.gr/64-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(298,1,'2016-01-20 14:59:03','2016-01-20 14:59:03','<h1>Buy a company in Switzerland</h1>\nStart Up Broker LC is the largest and most successful consultancy and brokerage company for small and medium-sized companies (SME) in Europe.

Take the time to read the following paragraphs containing excellent information about how you should best prepare yourself and what you have to expect. \n<ol>\n	<li>Decision to sell a company</li>\n	<li>What is the value of my company?</li>\n	<li>How can I increase the value of my company?</li>\n	<li>Confidentiality and discretion</li>\n	<li>What kind of documents are necessary?</li>\n	<li>What buyers want to know</li>\n	<li>The sales process</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Decision to sell the company</h2>\nYour decision to sell a company may be based on different circumstances. Whatever the reason is, for example retirement, changes in your private life, business-related circumstances or the wish to change your lifestyle, make sure that you have considered all other options and that you have thoroughly thought about your decision.\n\nThe decision to sell your own company may take a long time. Most people find it difficult to separate themselves from a company in which they have invested a lot of time and enthusiasm. The firm represents an important emotional value. Therefore, reconsider carefully all financial, juridical and emotional consequences before you reach the final decision to put your company on the market, otherwise you may lose a lot of time and money.\n\nSelling a company causes not only advertising and advisory costs, but financial consequences may also ensue due to possible delays in the selling process or the lack of the owner\'s entire concentration on the business.\n\nTherefore, it is important that you do make any \"experiments\" but that your approach is professional from the beginning and that you define your targets as detailed as possible. Once you have reached a final decision, the sales process should be carried out efficiently and at the best possible price.\n\nStart Up Broker LC is your best choice to take care of the sale of your business.\n<h2>What is the value of my company?</h2>\nTry to find out what the situation of your company on the market is. It is important to picture the value of your company from the viewpoint of a buyer in order to define a realistic price. Unfortunately, money cannot buy emotional value.\n\nIn a non-binding meeting, an advisor of Business Broker AG will help you get a clear picture about the sales price and the procedure of the sale. Business Broker AG has developed an evaluation system that is based on five different models. Each of these models work with a different starting point, which leads to a different company value. Then, we consolidate this information. Our experience helps us to evaluate a company value that corresponds to the effective sales price.\n\nVery often there are different opinions about a company\'s value. Inform yourself on how the price was determined. The better informed you are , the easier it will be to reach a decision. However, in the end, it is the market that determines the value of your company.\n<h2>How can I increase the value of my company?</h2>\nThis is the right time to embellish your company. Install a new company panel, change the floor carpet, recycle old and used material, and let the building be painted. Everything should look as perfect as possible. Do not assume that a new owner will take care of that or of the possibility to ask for a lower sales price instead.\n\nMake an in-depth analysis of your company. Do not forget important aspects that make your company attractive to a buyer, such as the value of client information, self-developed products and/or processes, well-maintained infrastructure, secret recipes, user-specific software programs or skilled staff. Such values are called immaterial goods. Unfortunately, most methods of price-evaluation do not take such values into consideration, but they still may be a factor that could increase your company value.\n<h2>Confidentiality and discretion</h2>\nConfidentiality and discretion are extremely important when selling a company. Information of a planned sale may always become public and running rumours may lead to the loss of important clients or staff. The damage may be enormous. Business Broker AG puts most emphasis on complete discretion during the entire procedure.\n\nWith our experience, we are in the position to promote your company in a professional way excluding the threat of a scenario as aforementioned will occur. All potential purchasers have to sign a confidentiality agreement before they will be provided with detailed information.\n<h2>What documents are necessary?</h2>\nPlease find the following checklist with documents necessary for the sale of a company:\n<ul>\n	<li>Balance sheet and profit and loss account of the last three years</li>\n	<li>Tax declaration form of the company of the last three years</li>\n	<li>VAT declaration of the last three years</li>\n	<li>List of the fixed assets including a table of depreciations</li>\n	<li>Copy of the tenancy agreement</li>\n	<li>List of loans and creditors of the company (amount, due date, repayment plan and interest rate)</li>\n	<li>List of debtors of the company (amount and due date)</li>\n	<li>List of stock of merchandise separated by category including table of depreciations</li>\n	<li>List of pending legal disputes (if applicable)</li>\n	<li>List of external advisors (if applicable)</li>\n</ul>\nOur advisors are happy to support you in organising and drawing up the necessary documents.\n<h2>What buyers should know</h2>\nThis question may come a little bit early to you since you have not reached the final decision to sell your company. However, it will surely help you to make the right decision. It is not only important to know, who the buyer is, but also what he or she wants to know when buying your company. The following are a few possible questions that you might be asked:\n<ul>\n	<li>How much money do I need to buy your company?</li>\n	<li>How high is the annual growth?</li>\n	<li>What is special, unique, out of the ordinary about your company?</li>\n	<li>What are the characteristics of your products or services?</li>\n	<li>What possible developments exist for your company?</li>\n	<li>Who is your main competitor?</li>\n	<li>What are the risks?</li>\n	<li>What kind of additional advantages can the buyer generate?</li>\n	<li>What is the situation of revenue in bad or in good times?</li>\n	<li>How big is the stock of merchandise?</li>\n	<li>How high is the indebtedness?</li>\n	<li>Is it planned that the seller will stay in the business for a certain period of time in order to train the new owner?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The sales process</h2>\nBusiness Broker AG will draw up an individual marketing plan for your company and implement the steps gradually. The buyers located with the help of that system will then be invited for a personal interview.  We will check their qualifications and present your company only to potential buyers. The next step will be to organise a site inspection of your company, which will happen in a very discreet way. We recommend you only answer technical questions, whereas your advisor will take care of questions related to company figures and the purchase price, which may already be subject to negotiation.\n\nIn case the potential buyer is still interested in your company, we will receive an offer for you. Usually, such an offer depends on one or several conditions, such as the buyer\'s request to examine your financial documents in detail, look into your tenancy agreement or other materially relevant details.\n\nWe will present you all offers that we receive for your company and, together, we will consider all the pros and cons. At first sight, you might not be satisfied with some points, some may not be according to your expectations but others may be very positive.\n\nIn any case, we recommend you to examine the offers thoroughly in order to be able to reach a substantiated decision. Either you reject an offer, you make a counter offer or you accept an offer.\n\nOnce you and the buyer have come to terms, we will ensure that the conditions are fulfilled as soon as possible. At this point, some buyers search advise of external advisors.

It is important to picture the value of your company from the viewpoint of a buyer in order to define a realistic price. Unfortunately, money cannot buy emotional value.\r\n\r\nIn a non-binding meeting, an advisor of Business Broker AG will help you get a clear picture about the sales price and the procedure of the sale.

Conclusion</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>1. General information on company valuation</h3>\nOne must basically differentiate between the theoretical value of the company and the realizable value of the company: The theoretical value of the company can be determined using various methods, each method generates different values. Therefore, there is no right or wrong theoretical value of the company, but different values, which are varying plausible for different viewers.\n\nThe realizable value of the company can only be established for a non-listed company if the company is actually sold. It is always a snapshot.\n\nAn assessment can be divided roughly into two types of methods: the net asset value and the income value. With the intrinsic value method, the company value is made up from the rated capacity, minus the rated debt. Here the assets can be used at book value, replacement or liquidation value. Hidden reserves must be considered accordingly.\n\nThe evaluated value of a company, it is not enough to use only the intrinsic value. The tangible assets alone do not create value, if a corresponding income is not earned. It can sometimes also be the case that with very little tangible assets one can generate a high revenue. Therefore, a company’s earning power also plays an important role in the evaluation.\n\nThe income capitalization methods show what can be earned on the existing assets. The earning power does not include the value of intangible assets such as components of the customer base, market position and reputation. It is also determined by the company’s strategy, the market situation and the capabilities of the management.\n<h3>2. Reasons and occasions for a company valuation</h3>\nThe reasons for carrying out a business valuation are varied. In the context of a corporate sale or succession planning, the business valuation is essential for determining the price. The company valuation is also a very valuable tool for corporate governance in strategy definition and selecting alternatives. Company valuations continue to be required in legal cases as part of an expert report as well as in the establishing and distributing inheritances.\n<h4>2.1 Company Sale/Succession Plan</h4>\nAs the owner of your company decides on either a sale or succession planning, it is important to assess the site by way of a company valuation. When evaluating a company is clear what value the company has at the time of the valuation. The right arguments can be found during the price negotiation phase by means of the factors analysed. The company value is therefore the same as an argumentation value. Different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic) are taken into account during the valuation. The argumentation value shows that the calculated value is generally not equal to the eventual price to be paid. There are additional specific and subjective aspects of negotiation.\n<h4>2.2 Strategy definition</h4>\nBased on a company valuation and the resulting lessons learned, improvement measures can be established in respect of a subsequent sale of the company. Since the value drivers of the shareholder value are crystallized in a valuation, it is possible to use this to (re)align strategy. It makes sense, for example, to check the value proposition of the individual cost components. The use of personnel, premises and the tied up capital (such as machinery or vehicles) should be scrutiniz and checked rigorously for possible savings. On the revenue side it is critical if the generated revenue of a business unit also has a positive impact on the overall profitability of the company or if it pushes this down.\n<h4>2.3 Arbitration value</h4>\nWhen parties are in dispute, it may be necessary to determine the arbitration value of a company. As an example, the divorce process can be named here, where there will be a dispute over the amount of the developed assets in the form of the company value. Business Broker AG has experience in the preparation of court reports and takes on the corresponding orders.\n<h4>2.4 Inheritance</h4>\nWould you like to know what the value of your business is and what value you want to leave your descendants one day, then it is essential to determine a company\'s value, which is not only theoretically correct, but can also be achieved. We will help you determine a value that is not beyond the market and based on assumptions, one that has a meaningful relationship to reality.\n\nIf you have undergone the painful experience of having lost a family member who has built up a company over the years and you (possibly jointly with other heirs) are now faced with the issue of succession, it is imperative for the parties to use a comprehensible company valuation oriented to market prices as a decision basis.\n<h3>3. Company valuation methods</h3>\nThere are a variety of company valuation methods, which as described above are divided into two basic categories: intrinsic value method and discounted earnings method. In addition, there are market value methods (multipliers, multiples), which are used for the valuation and which with other methods can make the obtained results plausible. It analyses what has already been paid in past transactions (Transaction Multiples) or what will be paid on the stock exchange for market prices (Trading Multiples). Furthermore, there are corporate policies that are theoretically correct, but not relevant in practice for SMEs, since they are simply not appropriate enough or are of too little importance or not documented enough (e.g. the valuation using the real options theory). In practice it is customary to use a valuation mix of the relevant methods. The valuation mix applied may vary industry to industry, however, it is based on the experience and the expertise of completed projects.\n\nStart Up Broker LC has extensive practical know-how, which they can draw on in each individual project valuation.\n<h4>3.1 Entity vs. Equity Approach</h4>\nTwo different perspectives and approaches can be pursued with all company valuation methods.\n\nThe entity approach takes into account the sources of income accruing to the equity investors and lenders. In other words, it is valued from the perspective of the overall company (Enterprise Value, Entity) and the gross value of the company is ascertained. If you subtract the debt, you get the net value of the company, which equals the equity. When selling a business it is the net value of the company that is relevant. This can also be derived directly from the equity approach. Only the equity holders who are entitled to sources income are capitalized. The direct derivation of the corporate value using the equity method is done, for example, in the stock assessment.\n<h4>3.2 Intrinsic-value method</h4>\nWith the intrinsic value method, all existing assets are in the balance sheet, so the assets of the company are summarized. The intrinsic value is usually calculated on going concern values (so-called reproductive values). All assets together form the total of the company’s assets and referred to as the gross asset value. To work out the net asset value of the company, i.e. the intrinsic value of equity, the debt (all debt and liabilities of the company) is deducted from the gross asset value.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"342\" />\n<h5>3.2.1 Book value, hidden reserves and deferred taxes</h5>\nThe assets in the financial accounting (balance control) represent book values and need to be revised first. The difference between the book values and the actual values includes undisclosed reserves to which the book values should be adjusted. The deferred taxes on hidden reserves can be drawn in since a positive influence is achieved on the income statement or a higher income is reported in a future release of hidden reserves. The deferred taxes can be taken into account when calculating the net asset values, in which the valuation difference (between book values and market values) is multiplied by half the tax rate and subtracted from the calculated net asset value. The use of half the tax rate takes into account, on the one hand, the subsequent collection of the taxes in time (time value of money) and, on the other hand, the scheduling of when to release the hidden reserves (the tax burden will not turn out quite so high).\n<h5>3.2.2 Going concern value (reproduction or replacement cost)</h5>\nWith the intrinsic value for the going concern value, assets are considered to be the value that they cost at today’s replacement cost at market prices. The continuation value thus indicates how much the replacement cost would be to reproduce the company. The acquisition values at current prices are used, from which the depreciation (consumption value) is deducted on grounds of age, resulting in the replacement value.\n<h5>3.2.3 Liquidation Value</h5>\nThe liquidation value is the value of the assets that can be attained after deduction of liabilities and liquidation costs. It should be noted that in a liquidation due to the tight time frame and because of the possible orientation of the assets to the purpose and the specialisation of the company, it may result in lower prices.\n<h5>3.2.4 Non-operational assets</h5>\nWhen valuing a company using the intrinsic value method, the operational assets are summed up in the first place. The company may have, however, additional non-operational assets such as real estate, which are not related to the operational activities, or there is excess liquidity that is not needed for the operation (this is not usually the case for smaller companies). These non-operational assets are to be listed separately or added in addition to the net intrinsic value and shown separately.\n<h5>3.2.5 Conclusion for the intrinsic value method</h5>\nThe intrinsic value is an inventory of existing holdings (assets), i.e. the existing matter of a company. The net intrinsic value represents the effective value of the equity, i.e. the corrected tax values of assets of the hidden reserves, minus the debts or liabilities of the company. The intrinsic value can be seen as a lower limit in the valuation of a company because tangible assets at the valuation point are physically present.\n<h4>3.3 Earning value methods</h4>\nThe earning value methods evaluate a company based on the anticipated sources of income, which the company will generate for the company owners in the future with the existing substance. The future sources of income may be in profits or cash flows. The individual earning value methods can be distinguished depending on the type of revenue. So the widespread Discounted Cash Flow method, valid as an assessment standard, is based on a cash flow factor and the pure earning value methods and also the excess profit methods to a profit factor. So-called dividend models (e.g. dividend discounting or the dividend growth model) are based on expected revenue in the form of dividends that accrue to the shareholders in the future. The dividend models are not listed here, because these are relevant for the stock assessment and also for listed companies with a constant dividend.\n<h5>3.3.1 Basic principles of the Earning Value Calculation</h5>\n<strong>3.3.1.1 Time value of the money and consideration of risks</strong>\nEarning value methods are all based on the same methodology: Anticipate revenue that accrues to the company owners in the future will be adjusted to the time of evaluation. The basic argument for this is the time value of money. This means that a franc is worth more today than tomorrow, as the money today can be invested at a specified interest rate (risk free market interest rate). In addition to the time value of money, the risk is taken into account, with which the returns vary in the future, what is referred to as so-called volatility. The higher the volatility, the higher the risk and therefore the cost of capital with which the time delayed revenues are discounted, i.e. are transferred to the valuation date. The cost of capital is an interest rate that considers both the temporal component mentioned, as well as the revealed risk. Discounting specifically means that a future form of income (FS) is divided by the term (1 + interest rate)<sup>period (T)</sup> to obtain the present value of the income (present value). The revenue can be profits or cash flows, which accrue at the end of each fiscal year to the company owner.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"621\" height=\"77\" />\n<strong>3.3.1.2 Determining the cost of capital</strong>\nThe amount of the capital costs has a major impact on a company\'s value, since the expected forms of revenue will be compared when evaluating the cost of capital and discounted at the WACC. The cost of capital consists of both the rates of return of equity (cost of equity) and debt capital (borrowing costs). To calculate the cost of capital, the cost of equity is weighted with the equity and debt capital costs by the percentage of debt. With the cost of debt, corporate taxes are also taken into account because the interest expenses are tax deductible. Hence the term tax-adjusted (WACC - Weighted Average Cost of Capital) is used (see Section 3.3.2 Discounted cash flow method). Equity is the most expensive capital. The required rate of return of the equity investors is much higher than the borrowing rate. By borrowing funds (for example in the form of a bank loan), the total capital costs are reduced, thereby changing the financing structure (it is the so-called financial leverage effect).\n\nThe required rate of equity can be determined using the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model). Here a risk premium and, where appropriate, risk increases for the limited trade ability (for listed companies) and the size (at small and medium-sized, unlisted companies) are added to a rate perceived as being without risk (e.g. 10-year Swiss government bond). The risk premium is derived from the product of the equity beta ß<sub>EK</sub> and the market risk premium or market returns. The equity beta beta ß<sub>EK</sub> indicates how much the stock price fluctuates compared to the market. The empirical determination of the equity beta ß<sub>EK</sub>implies a stock market listing. Since each company has a different funding structure and capital structure, this must be taken into account when calculating the beta. This is done with the so-called Hamada\'s formula, which transforms the beta values ß<sub>GK</sub> of the Stock Exchange (this refers only to the business risk) into the ß<sub>EK</sub>, which in addition to financial risk even incorporate the company-specific financial risk. For unlisted companies, determining the cost of equity is more difficult because there are no empirical data on market beta derivation. In determining the betas, only the experience of past transactions, especially in the field of small and medium companies, plays a very important role. In addition, comparative values of publicly traded companies in the same industry can be used.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"546\" />\n<h5>3.3.2 Discounted Cash Flow Method</h5>\nThe discounted cash flow method (DCF) is, as the name suggests, a cash flow-based company valuation method. First, the costs incurred in the future, so-called free cash flows are derived or predicted, and then using the tax-adjusted average cost of capital WACC<sub>s</sub> discounted at the valuation date.\n\n<strong>3.3.2.1 Calculation of Free Cash Flows (FCF)</strong>\nFree cash flow estimates the cash flow from business operations, which, after investment in net operating working capital and fixed assets into the company\'s owners are, so to speak, freely available.\n\nFree Cash Flow at Entity Level is derived as follows:\n<p class=\"paraBorder\">EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes)\n- Taxes on EBIT\n= NOPAT (Net operating profit after taxes)\n+ Depreciation on intangible assets\n+ Amortisation of intangible assets\n- Changes in Net Working Capital\n- Capital Expenditures (Capex)\n- Changes in Goodwill\n<strong>= Unlevered Free Cash Flow</strong></p>\nThe DCF method according to the entity approach is considered as Best Practice, whereby the free cash flows are discounted to entity level with the tax-adjusted average cost of capital WACC<sub>s</sub>. The tax adjustment with the WACC is necessary because in the calculation of free cash flow, taxes are directly deducted from EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). This is theoretically incorrect because the borrowing costs are tax deductible and so taxes must not be subtracted directly from the EBIT, but from the EBT (earnings before taxes) - (disclosure of too high taxes). Since in practice it is difficult, however, to predict the exact applicable taxes, the \"incorrectness\" mentioned in the WACC<sub>s</sub> is taken into account, so when determining the cost of debt, the taxes are incorporated and so the taxes that have been estimated too high are corrected again.\n\nAn income statement plan is drawn up for the next 4-5 years, starting from a valuation point. A simplified scenario is worked with for the time periods after the 4-5 years. A so-called residual value is determined. Here, the assumption is made that the investment currently meets the depreciation, so that the free cash flow to be discounted on a straight agrees on the entity level with the NOPAT (Net Operating Profit after Taxes). The gross value of the company consists of the actuarial value of free cash flow at the Entity level together with the cash value of the residual value.\n\nTo obtain the net value of the company, the value of equity, the net debt is subtracted from the company\'s gross value.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"456\" />\n<strong>3.3.2.2 Residual value, planning horizon, eternal growth</strong>\nThe difficulty in defining the planning horizon is the weighting of the residual value. The greater the number of planning years, the more difficult it is to plan the future free cash flows, because the quantity of the residual value is smaller than the value of the company. It therefore makes sense to forecast only about 4-5 years, as these are justifiable and understandable, and therefore accept a higher proportion of the residual value at the company\'s value.\n\nIn the planning of future profits or free cash flows one can make the assumption that profits should have an eternal growth after the planning horizon. In the denominator of the DCF formula, the growth rate g is then subtracted from the WACC<sub>s</sub>. The assumption of perpetual growth NOPAT is a very strong statement and must be viewed with great caution and above all provided with a reasonable and founded justification.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" />\n<h5>3.3.3 Pure earning value method</h5>\nAside from a detailed planning of the future years, one can perform a simplified earning value calculation. Here it is assumed that a perpetual profit (before interest payments) can be achieved and this profit corresponds as the equivalent to the free cash flow entity. This stems from the fact that there are no changes in working capital and that investments just meet the depreciation, which implies that only replacement investments will be made. The resulting profit is regarded as eternal and is hereby discounted with the non-tax adjusted WACC in this case, because the taxes in the calculation of EBIT (earnings before interest) are calculated correctly.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel07.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"208\" />\n<h5>3.3.4 Goodwill</h5>\nThe difference between the revenue value and the intrinsic value is called goodwill. Goodwill describes part of the purchase price, which is paid in addition to the value of the material elements of capital, for the customer base, reputation, brand, market position, access to the work performance of employees and for other intangible assets. The amount of goodwill sometimes depends on the industry sector. If a company sells a capital intensive business, the goodwill in relation to the sales price is considerably lower than in a pure service company, where there are tangible assets.\n<h5>3.3.5 Average value method (Mean value method)</h5>\nThe average method involves a weighted averaging of asset and revenue value.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel08.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"367\" />\n<h5>3.3.6 Excess profit methods</h5>\nThe intrinsic value method and the discounted cash flow method can be connected with each other using the excess profit process. Here recoverable excess profit is added to the gross asset value over a certain period T. The excess profit is the difference between the budgeted profit before tax (earnings before interest) and the normal profit, which is the product of asset value and the non-tax-adjusted cost of capital (WACC). The budgeted profit can be higher than normal profit, for example due to a strong market position, due to competitive advantages, but it is time limited. The excess profit adopted for a certain period is capitalised with the present value annuity factor, composed as in the following formula:\n\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"484\" />\n<h4>3.4 Market Value Method (multipliers, multiples)</h4>\nThe corporate value can be determined with publicly listed companies by the prices paid on the stock exchange (trading multiples) or compared with the acquisitions, transaction prices (Transaction multiples) already paid for by the company. Trading multiples and transaction multiples are summarised under the term of market multiples (multipliers). Important Market multiples are revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, net profit multiple, the price-earnings ratio (PER or P/E ratio) or the Market-to-book ratio, where the multiples are always a multiple of the listed figures. With unlisted companies a comparison is made with prices paid on the stock market, however, proven to be relatively difficult. A comparison may be of use when establishing a price range.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"361\" />\nIn the multiple-evaluation it is important that it starts from the same base. Either one rates at the corporate level (enterprise value, gross, unlevered) or at the equity level (equity value, net, levered). It is also useful to form an average of the individual multiples, so as to balance a possible bias or offset. Moreover, it makes sense to form an average over several years for each included Multiple.\n<h4>3.5 Ownership profit (EBITDA)</h4>\nParticular attention is given to the important EBITDA Multiple. EBITDA stands for <i>Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation (fixed assets) and amortisation (on intangible assets)</i>. This represents an important tool in corporate valuation especially for small and medium-sized companies. This multiplier is from the financing structure and influenced by the state of the investment cycle and therefore one of the most meaningful multipliers. A company that has just invested finds itself confronted with higher depreciation and a lower profit than a company that has made no investments over time.\n\nThe owner of earnings based on the EBITDA represents the actual cash flow generated, adjusted to reflect corrections and before depreciation. If one adds the gross salary (including benefits) to the EBITDA that the owner of the company has paid out to himself, this results in the owner earnings (EBITDA level). Multiplied by a certain factor, this represents a fundamental price indicator in particular regarding the evaluation of the profitability of small and medium-sized companies, which a DCF valuation may not make much sense. The origin of the term: owner’s profit (EBITDA), owner’s cash flows come from the Anglo-American term. Usually the owners themselves are active in the company and will benefit from various services provided by the company for him. In relation to an employee he would have to finance for such benefits for himself from his work income.\n\nThe starting point for calculating the owner’s profit at EBITDA level is always the EBITDA according to the financial statements. To which the following adjustments or corrections are to be made:\n<div class=\"divBorder\">\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>EBITDA according to the financial statements</strong></li>\n	<li>Addition of the gross salary of the owner or owners (including bonuses, bonuses and benefits)</li>\n	<li>Addition of additional charges which are not included in the gross wage</li>\n	<li>One-off addition/subtraction, non-recurring expenses/revenues, which were debited/credited to the P&amp;L account</li>\n	<li>Addition/subtraction income/expenses not operationally required, which were debited/credited to the P&amp;L account</li>\n	<li>Addition/subtraction of income/expenses of a private nature, which were billed to the business</li>\n	<li>Addition/Subtraction formation/release of hidden reserves</li>\n	<li>Addition of easily and quickly realisable savings</li>\n	<li><strong>= owner’s profit at EBITDA level</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\nWith over 100 sales of companies in the past four years, Business Broker AG has built up a very valuable database in terms of multiples, which are actually paid in the area of small and medium sized companies. Of course, this requires a prior revision of the financial statements as listed above.\n<h3>4. Procedure during a company valuation</h3>\nTo perform a meaningful due diligence, regardless of the method chosen, some key steps are to be considered:\n<ul>\n	<li>Revision of the financial statements</li>\n	<li>Business valuation with a method mix</li>\n	<li>Comparison and interpretation of results</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1 The revision of financial statements</h4>\nThe balance sheets and income statements for the past 3 years must be revised for non-operating, and extraordinary personal income and expenses or assets and liabilities. Examples of this can also include rented business premises, which are shown as an expense in the P&amp;L account, but are not required for the business activities. Or the owner runs an expensive car and pays for its leasing costs through the business. These additional expenditures are to be neutralised or taken out.\n<h4>4.2 Company valuation Method mix</h4>\nThe presentation and selection of assessment methods always gives rise to discussions. First, it should be noted that a company valuation method is limited to its own explanatory power. In our experience, the mix of company valuation methods has proven successful. The intrinsic value can be regarded as a lower limit in the definition of a bandwidth value. Thereafter, the earning value is determined using the discounted cash flow method and is weighted and combined together with the earning value discussed by multiples, which is already a temporal and methodological average, according to the average value method (this is often the mean value method). So we combine the discounted cash flow method with our extensive knowledge from existing transactions (Transaction multiples).\n<h4>4.3 Comparison and interpretation of the results</h4>\n<h5>4.3.1 Plausibility check</h5>\nThe plausibility of the valuation results can be done with technically simple valuation methods, like the pure income capitalisation method is. This makes sense particularly with the discounted cash flow method, in which the cost of capital, the planning figures and the residual value represent particularly value-sensitive factors, this makes sense. Furthermore, plausibility checks can be made with multiples. Crucial to the plausibility test, however, is the experience of the consultant from other projects. An experienced consultant can use his knowledge of the existing company valuations that come from different industries and are characterised by a variety of company-specific traits, for profit. He has developed over time a practical and goal-oriented perspective and is able to assess very carefully whether it makes sense to determine company value and apply a mix of methods or not.\n\nWith a company valuation, assumptions are made regarding the sales development and also the development of costs (staff costs, material costs, other operating expenses). In addition, with the earning value method, a certain cost of capital is set and used for discounting the flow of revenue. As the future is uncertain, it makes sense to work with different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic), especially with regard to the sales of a company, which may depend in particular on the industry or market development, and with respect to different levels of capital cost percentages (company-specific risks). With the change in the cost of capital, it is easy to see how sensitively the earning value reacts.\n<h5>4.3.2 Traceability</h5>\nIt is essential that the assumptions are critically analysed, especially with the earning value methods (specially the DCF method). One deals intensively with the company\'s business model and value factors, which responds sensitively to an assessment. It is not done with a purely technical valuation on the basis of a business plan or planning figures (plan P&amp;L statements, projected balance sheets, schedule of cash flows). The assumptions must be readily comprehensible, so that an outsider sees and also understands the most important value driver on the valuation of a business.\n<h3>5. Conclusion</h3>\nThe company valuation is not about finding the absolutely correct value. Company values do not represent pure objective values, instead they are based on many subjective assumptions. The point is to determine a value bandwidth, which can be used for plausibility and communication purposes. The bandwidth value of the earning value comes from the fact that different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic) and various other assumptions are made. The income/cost development is evaluated and so are the business and financial risks of the company and the industry development of different variants. A lower limit is determined based on the intrinsic value that is physically present and which varies depending on the capital intensity of operations. Depending on the scenario, then the return value and the goodwill to be attained are specified as the difference between the earning and net asset value. All the results obtained in the context of a company valuation require expert assessment and a plausibility check. Only those who can see the value driving factors and an assessment of the underlying assumptions in detail, will be in a position to interpret the calculated value of the company.\n\n&nbsp;\n<div class=\"callToAction_button\"><a class=\"callToAction_buttonText\" href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></div>\n<span class=\"callToAction_text\">Ask for our no-obligation information pack:</span>','Valuation methods','','inherit','closed','closed','','80-autosave-v1','','','2016-01-20 15:15:31','2016-01-20 15:15:31','',80,'http://startupbroker.gr/80-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(309,1,'2016-01-20 15:16:36','2016-01-20 15:16:36','<h1>Methods and procedures for company valuation in practice</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>The valuation of a company is an extremely challenging task.

Conclusion</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>1. General information on company valuation</h3>\r\nOne must basically differentiate between the theoretical value of the company and the realizable value of the company: The theoretical value of the company can be determined using various methods, each method generates different values. Therefore, there is no right or wrong theoretical value of the company, but different values, which are varying plausible for different viewers.\r\n\r\nThe realizable value of the company can only be established for a non-listed company if the company is actually sold. It is always a snapshot.\r\n\r\nAn assessment can be divided roughly into two types of methods: the net asset value and the income value. With the intrinsic value method, the company value is made up from the rated capacity, minus the rated debt. Here the assets can be used at book value, replacement or liquidation value. Hidden reserves must be considered accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe evaluated value of a company, it is not enough to use only the intrinsic value. The tangible assets alone do not create value, if a corresponding income is not earned. It can sometimes also be the case that with very little tangible assets one can generate a high revenue. Therefore, a company’s earning power also plays an important role in the evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe income capitalization methods show what can be earned on the existing assets. The earning power does not include the value of intangible assets such as components of the customer base, market position and reputation. It is also determined by the company’s strategy, the market situation and the capabilities of the management.\r\n<h3>2. Reasons and occasions for a company valuation</h3>\r\nThe reasons for carrying out a business valuation are varied. In the context of a corporate sale or succession planning, the business valuation is essential for determining the price. The company valuation is also a very valuable tool for corporate governance in strategy definition and selecting alternatives. Company valuations continue to be required in legal cases as part of an expert report as well as in the establishing and distributing inheritances.\r\n<h4>2.1 Company Sale/Succession Plan</h4>\r\nAs the owner of your company decides on either a sale or succession planning, it is important to assess the site by way of a company valuation. When evaluating a company is clear what value the company has at the time of the valuation. The right arguments can be found during the price negotiation phase by means of the factors analysed. The company value is therefore the same as an argumentation value. Different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic) are taken into account during the valuation. The argumentation value shows that the calculated value is generally not equal to the eventual price to be paid. There are additional specific and subjective aspects of negotiation.\r\n<h4>2.2 Strategy definition</h4>\r\nBased on a company valuation and the resulting lessons learned, improvement measures can be established in respect of a subsequent sale of the company. Since the value drivers of the shareholder value are crystallized in a valuation, it is possible to use this to (re)align strategy. It makes sense, for example, to check the value proposition of the individual cost components. The use of personnel, premises and the tied up capital (such as machinery or vehicles) should be scrutiniz and checked rigorously for possible savings. On the revenue side it is critical if the generated revenue of a business unit also has a positive impact on the overall profitability of the company or if it pushes this down.\r\n<h4>2.3 Arbitration value</h4>\r\nWhen parties are in dispute, it may be necessary to determine the arbitration value of a company. As an example, the divorce process can be named here, where there will be a dispute over the amount of the developed assets in the form of the company value. Business Broker AG has experience in the preparation of court reports and takes on the corresponding orders.\r\n<h4>2.4 Inheritance</h4>\r\nWould you like to know what the value of your business is and what value you want to leave your descendants one day, then it is essential to determine a company\'s value, which is not only theoretically correct, but can also be achieved. We will help you determine a value that is not beyond the market and based on assumptions, one that has a meaningful relationship to reality.\r\n\r\nIf you have undergone the painful experience of having lost a family member who has built up a company over the years and you (possibly jointly with other heirs) are now faced with the issue of succession, it is imperative for the parties to use a comprehensible company valuation oriented to market prices as a decision basis.\r\n<h3>3. Company valuation methods</h3>\r\nThere are a variety of company valuation methods, which as described above are divided into two basic categories: intrinsic value method and discounted earnings method. In addition, there are market value methods (multipliers, multiples), which are used for the valuation and which with other methods can make the obtained results plausible. It analyses what has already been paid in past transactions (Transaction Multiples) or what will be paid on the stock exchange for market prices (Trading Multiples). Furthermore, there are corporate policies that are theoretically correct, but not relevant in practice for SMEs, since they are simply not appropriate enough or are of too little importance or not documented enough (e.g. the valuation using the real options theory). In practice it is customary to use a valuation mix of the relevant methods. The valuation mix applied may vary industry to industry, however, it is based on the experience and the expertise of completed projects.\r\n\r\nStart Up Broker LC has extensive practical know-how, which they can draw on in each individual project valuation.\r\n<h4>3.1 Entity vs. Equity Approach</h4>\r\nTwo different perspectives and approaches can be pursued with all company valuation methods.\r\n\r\nThe entity approach takes into account the sources of income accruing to the equity investors and lenders. In other words, it is valued from the perspective of the overall company (Enterprise Value, Entity) and the gross value of the company is ascertained. If you subtract the debt, you get the net value of the company, which equals the equity. When selling a business it is the net value of the company that is relevant. This can also be derived directly from the equity approach. Only the equity holders who are entitled to sources income are capitalized. The direct derivation of the corporate value using the equity method is done, for example, in the stock assessment.\r\n<h4>3.2 Intrinsic-value method</h4>\r\nWith the intrinsic value method, all existing assets are in the balance sheet, so the assets of the company are summarized. The intrinsic value is usually calculated on going concern values (so-called reproductive values). All assets together form the total of the company’s assets and referred to as the gross asset value. To work out the net asset value of the company, i.e. the intrinsic value of equity, the debt (all debt and liabilities of the company) is deducted from the gross asset value.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"342\" />\r\n<h5>3.2.1 Book value, hidden reserves and deferred taxes</h5>\r\nThe assets in the financial accounting (balance control) represent book values and need to be revised first. The difference between the book values and the actual values includes undisclosed reserves to which the book values should be adjusted. The deferred taxes on hidden reserves can be drawn in since a positive influence is achieved on the income statement or a higher income is reported in a future release of hidden reserves. The deferred taxes can be taken into account when calculating the net asset values, in which the valuation difference (between book values and market values) is multiplied by half the tax rate and subtracted from the calculated net asset value. The use of half the tax rate takes into account, on the one hand, the subsequent collection of the taxes in time (time value of money) and, on the other hand, the scheduling of when to release the hidden reserves (the tax burden will not turn out quite so high).\r\n<h5>3.2.2 Going concern value (reproduction or replacement cost)</h5>\r\nWith the intrinsic value for the going concern value, assets are considered to be the value that they cost at today’s replacement cost at market prices. The continuation value thus indicates how much the replacement cost would be to reproduce the company. The acquisition values at current prices are used, from which the depreciation (consumption value) is deducted on grounds of age, resulting in the replacement value.\r\n<h5>3.2.3 Liquidation Value</h5>\r\nThe liquidation value is the value of the assets that can be attained after deduction of liabilities and liquidation costs. It should be noted that in a liquidation due to the tight time frame and because of the possible orientation of the assets to the purpose and the specialisation of the company, it may result in lower prices.\r\n<h5>3.2.4 Non-operational assets</h5>\r\nWhen valuing a company using the intrinsic value method, the operational assets are summed up in the first place. The company may have, however, additional non-operational assets such as real estate, which are not related to the operational activities, or there is excess liquidity that is not needed for the operation (this is not usually the case for smaller companies). These non-operational assets are to be listed separately or added in addition to the net intrinsic value and shown separately.\r\n<h5>3.2.5 Conclusion for the intrinsic value method</h5>\r\nThe intrinsic value is an inventory of existing holdings (assets), i.e. the existing matter of a company. The net intrinsic value represents the effective value of the equity, i.e. the corrected tax values of assets of the hidden reserves, minus the debts or liabilities of the company. The intrinsic value can be seen as a lower limit in the valuation of a company because tangible assets at the valuation point are physically present.\r\n<h4>3.3 Earning value methods</h4>\r\nThe earning value methods evaluate a company based on the anticipated sources of income, which the company will generate for the company owners in the future with the existing substance. The future sources of income may be in profits or cash flows. The individual earning value methods can be distinguished depending on the type of revenue. So the widespread Discounted Cash Flow method, valid as an assessment standard, is based on a cash flow factor and the pure earning value methods and also the excess profit methods to a profit factor. So-called dividend models (e.g. dividend discounting or the dividend growth model) are based on expected revenue in the form of dividends that accrue to the shareholders in the future. The dividend models are not listed here, because these are relevant for the stock assessment and also for listed companies with a constant dividend.\r\n<h5>3.3.1 Basic principles of the Earning Value Calculation</h5>\r\n<strong>3.3.1.1 Time value of the money and consideration of risks</strong>\r\nEarning value methods are all based on the same methodology: Anticipate revenue that accrues to the company owners in the future will be adjusted to the time of evaluation. The basic argument for this is the time value of money. This means that a franc is worth more today than tomorrow, as the money today can be invested at a specified interest rate (risk free market interest rate). In addition to the time value of money, the risk is taken into account, with which the returns vary in the future, what is referred to as so-called volatility. The higher the volatility, the higher the risk and therefore the cost of capital with which the time delayed revenues are discounted, i.e. are transferred to the valuation date. The cost of capital is an interest rate that considers both the temporal component mentioned, as well as the revealed risk. Discounting specifically means that a future form of income (FS) is divided by the term (1 + interest rate)<sup>period (T)</sup> to obtain the present value of the income (present value). The revenue can be profits or cash flows, which accrue at the end of each fiscal year to the company owner.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"621\" height=\"77\" />\r\n<strong>3.3.1.2 Determining the cost of capital</strong>\r\nThe amount of the capital costs has a major impact on a company\'s value, since the expected forms of revenue will be compared when evaluating the cost of capital and discounted at the WACC. The cost of capital consists of both the rates of return of equity (cost of equity) and debt capital (borrowing costs). To calculate the cost of capital, the cost of equity is weighted with the equity and debt capital costs by the percentage of debt. With the cost of debt, corporate taxes are also taken into account because the interest expenses are tax deductible. Hence the term tax-adjusted (WACC - Weighted Average Cost of Capital) is used (see Section 3.3.2 Discounted cash flow method). Equity is the most expensive capital. The required rate of return of the equity investors is much higher than the borrowing rate. By borrowing funds (for example in the form of a bank loan), the total capital costs are reduced, thereby changing the financing structure (it is the so-called financial leverage effect).\r\n\r\nThe required rate of equity can be determined using the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model). Here a risk premium and, where appropriate, risk increases for the limited trade ability (for listed companies) and the size (at small and medium-sized, unlisted companies) are added to a rate perceived as being without risk (e.g. 10-year Swiss government bond). The risk premium is derived from the product of the equity beta ß<sub>EK</sub> and the market risk premium or market returns. The equity beta beta ß<sub>EK</sub> indicates how much the stock price fluctuates compared to the market. The empirical determination of the equity beta ß<sub>EK</sub>implies a stock market listing. Since each company has a different funding structure and capital structure, this must be taken into account when calculating the beta. This is done with the so-called Hamada\'s formula, which transforms the beta values ß<sub>GK</sub> of the Stock Exchange (this refers only to the business risk) into the ß<sub>EK</sub>, which in addition to financial risk even incorporate the company-specific financial risk. For unlisted companies, determining the cost of equity is more difficult because there are no empirical data on market beta derivation. In determining the betas, only the experience of past transactions, especially in the field of small and medium companies, plays a very important role. In addition, comparative values of publicly traded companies in the same industry can be used.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"546\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.2 Discounted Cash Flow Method</h5>\r\nThe discounted cash flow method (DCF) is, as the name suggests, a cash flow-based company valuation method. First, the costs incurred in the future, so-called free cash flows are derived or predicted, and then using the tax-adjusted average cost of capital WACC<sub>s</sub> discounted at the valuation date.\r\n\r\n<strong>3.3.2.1 Calculation of Free Cash Flows (FCF)</strong>\r\nFree cash flow estimates the cash flow from business operations, which, after investment in net operating working capital and fixed assets into the company\'s owners are, so to speak, freely available.\r\n\r\nFree Cash Flow at Entity Level is derived as follows:\r\n<p class=\"paraBorder\">EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes)\r\n- Taxes on EBIT\r\n= NOPAT (Net operating profit after taxes)\r\n+ Depreciation on intangible assets\r\n+ Amortisation of intangible assets\r\n- Changes in Net Working Capital\r\n- Capital Expenditures (Capex)\r\n- Changes in Goodwill\r\n<strong>= Unlevered Free Cash Flow</strong></p>\r\nThe DCF method according to the entity approach is considered as Best Practice, whereby the free cash flows are discounted to entity level with the tax-adjusted average cost of capital WACC<sub>s</sub>. The tax adjustment with the WACC is necessary because in the calculation of free cash flow, taxes are directly deducted from EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). This is theoretically incorrect because the borrowing costs are tax deductible and so taxes must not be subtracted directly from the EBIT, but from the EBT (earnings before taxes) - (disclosure of too high taxes). Since in practice it is difficult, however, to predict the exact applicable taxes, the \"incorrectness\" mentioned in the WACC<sub>s</sub> is taken into account, so when determining the cost of debt, the taxes are incorporated and so the taxes that have been estimated too high are corrected again.\r\n\r\nAn income statement plan is drawn up for the next 4-5 years, starting from a valuation point. A simplified scenario is worked with for the time periods after the 4-5 years. A so-called residual value is determined. Here, the assumption is made that the investment currently meets the depreciation, so that the free cash flow to be discounted on a straight agrees on the entity level with the NOPAT (Net Operating Profit after Taxes). The gross value of the company consists of the actuarial value of free cash flow at the Entity level together with the cash value of the residual value.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the net value of the company, the value of equity, the net debt is subtracted from the company\'s gross value.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"456\" />\r\n<strong>3.3.2.2 Residual value, planning horizon, eternal growth</strong>\r\nThe difficulty in defining the planning horizon is the weighting of the residual value. The greater the number of planning years, the more difficult it is to plan the future free cash flows, because the quantity of the residual value is smaller than the value of the company. It therefore makes sense to forecast only about 4-5 years, as these are justifiable and understandable, and therefore accept a higher proportion of the residual value at the company\'s value.\r\n\r\nIn the planning of future profits or free cash flows one can make the assumption that profits should have an eternal growth after the planning horizon. In the denominator of the DCF formula, the growth rate g is then subtracted from the WACC<sub>s</sub>. The assumption of perpetual growth NOPAT is a very strong statement and must be viewed with great caution and above all provided with a reasonable and founded justification.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.3 Pure earning value method</h5>\r\nAside from a detailed planning of the future years, one can perform a simplified earning value calculation. Here it is assumed that a perpetual profit (before interest payments) can be achieved and this profit corresponds as the equivalent to the free cash flow entity. This stems from the fact that there are no changes in working capital and that investments just meet the depreciation, which implies that only replacement investments will be made. The resulting profit is regarded as eternal and is hereby discounted with the non-tax adjusted WACC in this case, because the taxes in the calculation of EBIT (earnings before interest) are calculated correctly.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel07.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"208\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.4 Goodwill</h5>\r\nThe difference between the revenue value and the intrinsic value is called goodwill. Goodwill describes part of the purchase price, which is paid in addition to the value of the material elements of capital, for the customer base, reputation, brand, market position, access to the work performance of employees and for other intangible assets. The amount of goodwill sometimes depends on the industry sector. If a company sells a capital intensive business, the goodwill in relation to the sales price is considerably lower than in a pure service company, where there are tangible assets.\r\n<h5>3.3.5 Average value method (Mean value method)</h5>\r\nThe average method involves a weighted averaging of asset and revenue value.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel08.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"367\" />\r\n<h5>3.3.6 Excess profit methods</h5>\r\nThe intrinsic value method and the discounted cash flow method can be connected with each other using the excess profit process. Here recoverable excess profit is added to the gross asset value over a certain period T. The excess profit is the difference between the budgeted profit before tax (earnings before interest) and the normal profit, which is the product of asset value and the non-tax-adjusted cost of capital (WACC). The budgeted profit can be higher than normal profit, for example due to a strong market position, due to competitive advantages, but it is time limited. The excess profit adopted for a certain period is capitalised with the present value annuity factor, composed as in the following formula:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"484\" />\r\n<h4>3.4 Market Value Method (multipliers, multiples)</h4>\r\nThe corporate value can be determined with publicly listed companies by the prices paid on the stock exchange (trading multiples) or compared with the acquisitions, transaction prices (Transaction multiples) already paid for by the company. Trading multiples and transaction multiples are summarised under the term of market multiples (multipliers). Important Market multiples are revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, net profit multiple, the price-earnings ratio (PER or P/E ratio) or the Market-to-book ratio, where the multiples are always a multiple of the listed figures. With unlisted companies a comparison is made with prices paid on the stock market, however, proven to be relatively difficult. A comparison may be of use when establishing a price range.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.businessbroker.ch/Portals/0/Content/Bewertungsmethoden/en/Formel10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"361\" />\r\nIn the multiple-evaluation it is important that it starts from the same base. Either one rates at the corporate level (enterprise value, gross, unlevered) or at the equity level (equity value, net, levered). It is also useful to form an average of the individual multiples, so as to balance a possible bias or offset. Moreover, it makes sense to form an average over several years for each included Multiple.\r\n<h4>3.5 Ownership profit (EBITDA)</h4>\r\nParticular attention is given to the important EBITDA Multiple. EBITDA stands for <i>Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation (fixed assets) and amortisation (on intangible assets)</i>. This represents an important tool in corporate valuation especially for small and medium-sized companies. This multiplier is from the financing structure and influenced by the state of the investment cycle and therefore one of the most meaningful multipliers. A company that has just invested finds itself confronted with higher depreciation and a lower profit than a company that has made no investments over time.\r\n\r\nThe owner of earnings based on the EBITDA represents the actual cash flow generated, adjusted to reflect corrections and before depreciation. If one adds the gross salary (including benefits) to the EBITDA that the owner of the company has paid out to himself, this results in the owner earnings (EBITDA level). Multiplied by a certain factor, this represents a fundamental price indicator in particular regarding the evaluation of the profitability of small and medium-sized companies, which a DCF valuation may not make much sense. The origin of the term: owner’s profit (EBITDA), owner’s cash flows come from the Anglo-American term. Usually the owners themselves are active in the company and will benefit from various services provided by the company for him. In relation to an employee he would have to finance for such benefits for himself from his work income.\r\n\r\nThe starting point for calculating the owner’s profit at EBITDA level is always the EBITDA according to the financial statements. To which the following adjustments or corrections are to be made:\r\n<div class=\"divBorder\">\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>EBITDA according to the financial statements</strong></li>\r\n	<li>Addition of the gross salary of the owner or owners (including bonuses, bonuses and benefits)</li>\r\n	<li>Addition of additional charges which are not included in the gross wage</li>\r\n	<li>One-off addition/subtraction, non-recurring expenses/revenues, which were debited/credited to the P&amp;L account</li>\r\n	<li>Addition/subtraction income/expenses not operationally required, which were debited/credited to the P&amp;L account</li>\r\n	<li>Addition/subtraction of income/expenses of a private nature, which were billed to the business</li>\r\n	<li>Addition/Subtraction formation/release of hidden reserves</li>\r\n	<li>Addition of easily and quickly realisable savings</li>\r\n	<li><strong>= owner’s profit at EBITDA level</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\nWith over 100 sales of companies in the past four years, Start Up Broker LC has built up a very valuable database in terms of multiples, which are actually paid in the area of small and medium sized companies. Of course, this requires a prior revision of the financial statements as listed above.\r\n<h3>4. Procedure during a company valuation</h3>\r\nTo perform a meaningful due diligence, regardless of the method chosen, some key steps are to be considered:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Revision of the financial statements</li>\r\n	<li>Business valuation with a method mix</li>\r\n	<li>Comparison and interpretation of results</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>4.1 The revision of financial statements</h4>\r\nThe balance sheets and income statements for the past 3 years must be revised for non-operating, and extraordinary personal income and expenses or assets and liabilities. Examples of this can also include rented business premises, which are shown as an expense in the P&amp;L account, but are not required for the business activities. Or the owner runs an expensive car and pays for its leasing costs through the business. These additional expenditures are to be neutralized or taken out.\r\n<h4>4.2 Company valuation Method mix</h4>\r\nThe presentation and selection of assessment methods always gives rise to discussions. First, it should be noted that a company valuation method is limited to its own explanatory power. In our experience, the mix of company valuation methods has proven successful. The intrinsic value can be regarded as a lower limit in the definition of a bandwidth value. Thereafter, the earning value is determined using the discounted cash flow method and is weighted and combined together with the earning value discussed by multiples, which is already a temporal and methodological average, according to the average value method (this is often the mean value method). So we combine the discounted cash flow method with our extensive knowledge from existing transactions (Transaction multiples).\r\n<h4>4.3 Comparison and interpretation of the results</h4>\r\n<h5>4.3.1 Plausibility check</h5>\r\nThe plausibility of the valuation results can be done with technically simple valuation methods, like the pure income capitalisation method is. This makes sense particularly with the discounted cash flow method, in which the cost of capital, the planning figures and the residual value represent particularly value-sensitive factors, this makes sense. Furthermore, plausibility checks can be made with multiples. Crucial to the plausibility test, however, is the experience of the consultant from other projects. An experienced consultant can use his knowledge of the existing company valuations that come from different industries and are characterised by a variety of company-specific traits, for profit. He has developed over time a practical and goal-oriented perspective and is able to assess very carefully whether it makes sense to determine company value and apply a mix of methods or not.\r\n\r\nWith a company valuation, assumptions are made regarding the sales development and also the development of costs (staff costs, material costs, other operating expenses). In addition, with the earning value method, a certain cost of capital is set and used for discounting the flow of revenue. As the future is uncertain, it makes sense to work with different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic), especially with regard to the sales of a company, which may depend in particular on the industry or market development, and with respect to different levels of capital cost percentages (company-specific risks). With the change in the cost of capital, it is easy to see how sensitively the earning value reacts.\r\n<h5>4.3.2 Traceability</h5>\r\nIt is essential that the assumptions are critically analysed, especially with the earning value methods (specially the DCF method). One deals intensively with the company\'s business model and value factors, which responds sensitively to an assessment. It is not done with a purely technical valuation on the basis of a business plan or planning figures (plan P&amp;L statements, projected balance sheets, schedule of cash flows). The assumptions must be readily comprehensible, so that an outsider sees and also understands the most important value driver on the valuation of a business.\r\n<h3>5. Conclusion</h3>\r\nThe company valuation is not about finding the absolutely correct value. Company values do not represent pure objective values, instead they are based on many subjective assumptions. The point is to determine a value bandwidth, which can be used for plausibility and communication purposes. The bandwidth value of the earning value comes from the fact that different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic) and various other assumptions are made. The income/cost development is evaluated and so are the business and financial risks of the company and the industry development of different variants. A lower limit is determined based on the intrinsic value that is physically present and which varies depending on the capital intensity of operations. Depending on the scenario, then the return value and the goodwill to be attained are specified as the difference between the earning and net asset value. All the results obtained in the context of a company valuation require expert assessment and a plausibility check. Only those who can see the value driving factors and an assessment of the underlying assumptions in detail, will be in a position to interpret the calculated value of the company.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div class=\"callToAction_button\"><a class=\"callToAction_buttonText\" href=\"/contact/\">contact</a></div>\r\n<span class=\"callToAction_text\">Ask for our no-obligation information pack:</span>','Valuation methods','','inherit','closed','closed','','80-revision-v1','','','2016-01-20 15:16:36','2016-01-20 15:16:36','',80,'http://startupbroker.gr/80-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(310,1,'2016-01-20 15:17:29','2016-01-20 15:17:29','<h1>Succession Advice</h1>\r\n<strong>Start Up Broker LC has already supported more than 300 successions.

The combat introduced powerful new weaponry that culminated inside of the first of all testing of nuclear tools. It demanded a massive concept of development abilities, which provided surge to world\'s biggest business creation of these tools across the world. World War 2 and its around the world get in touch with challenged lots of nations around the world to go up and ruin the axis, that had been commanded with the German director, Adolf Hitler, in European countries. Along with the beginnings among the Outstanding War securely planted, The Second World War was just an extension of the previous clashes, plus it watched the growing fusion of men and appliance to create a considerably more horrifying battling push. </p>  <p>The Second World War witnessed the development of numerous cutting-benefit and often bizarre weaponry, a good number of and this includes growing into actually famous. Having said that, examples of the tools not ever obtained a similar model of notoriety. It truly is really worth noting that in addition to the weaponry which have been put on on the earth Warfare II, there have been plenty of outrageous and intangible tools which were taken into account, however they have been not utilized. The foremost and most toxic tool of The Second World War was the V3 Cannon. The same as the V2 rocket plus the V1 cruise ship missile which come right before it, the V3 Cannon was the huge tremendous rifle. It actually was set up directly into a slope and was efficient at firing weaponry seashells from France to Central london across the English language Route. The V3 Cannon operated as stated by multi-demand standards when the secondary propellant charges seemed to be fired first to boost the projectiles steadily given that they relocated over the barrels in the cannon. The V3 was able to drive seashells to a length of 93 mls. </p>  <p>The next weapon used in The Second World War was the Dora and Gustav Rail Cannons. These 32.5-\" grade cannons were being unquestionably behemoths. In general, these canons were the biggest cannons that the whole planet has ever in your life observed. These folks were so huge that each one needed to be sent in numerous articles, established, and finally be mounted on a nicely-completely ready emplacement. This whole practice called for about 4,000 gentlemen! The penetrative potency for this seashells that weighed 11,000 excess weight was a <a href=\"http://essayonlinewriter.com/write-my-essay/\">http://essayonlinewriter.com/write-my-essay/</a> good amount of to abolish an ammunition put safeguarded by anywhere up to 100 foot of rock and roll. Tool professionals similar to Alexander Ludeke known as cannons “technological works of art.” But nevertheless, he applied they were a good deal of waste material of materials, effort, and electronic competency. </p>  <p>One of the The Second World War weaponry was the Unrotated Projectile. It was just one of the hints that checked plausible in writing, but proven awful when insert to practice. The Unrotated Projectile was actually a British creativity that comprised of a shorter array of rocket-firing contra --aircraft missile with suffered from wire connections and parachutes placed on it. The objective pertaining to the whole set of innovations would be to come up with an aerial minefield. As being the rockets over time drifted back, almost every other aircraft piloting through the entire position spot will probably be of remarkable probability of catching a cable television that might take the rocket in direction of it and explode on have an impact on. The highest hassle was a small enhance of wind flow posed the danger of rendering the rocket drift to return on the same cruise ship that brought out them. </p>  <p>Finally, the warfare discovered a tool referred to as the Goliath-tracked mine. The tool got its start through Allies and was actually a far off-taken care of demolition provider. It was initially introduced by the Germans that year 1942 to use to transport a 166 lb bomb to goals together with tanks, bridges, thick infantry formations, and complexes. These electric motor equipment ended up wire-controlled, and in addition they erupted on connection with their concentrates on. Unluckily, on the Germans, the cars or trucks was sluggish, very difficult to charge, and then the payloads happen to be excessively smallish. Since it ended up, the idea was ahead of its time simply because it became a precursor into the trendy robots.

The combat introduced powerful new weaponry that culminated inside of the first of all testing of nuclear tools. It demanded a massive concept of development abilities, which provided surge to world\'s biggest business creation of these tools across the world. World War 2 and its around the world get in touch with challenged lots of nations around the world to go up and ruin the axis, that had been commanded with the German director, Adolf Hitler, in European countries. Along with the beginnings among the Outstanding War securely planted, The Second World War was just an extension of the previous clashes, plus it watched the growing fusion of men and appliance to create a considerably more horrifying battling push. </p>  <p>The Second World War witnessed the development of numerous cutting-benefit and often bizarre weaponry, a good number of and this includes growing into actually famous. Having said that, examples of the tools not ever obtained a similar model of notoriety. It truly is really worth noting that in addition to the weaponry which have been put on on the earth Warfare II, there have been plenty of outrageous and intangible tools which were taken into account, however they have been not utilized. The foremost and most toxic tool of The Second World War was the V3 Cannon. The same as the V2 rocket plus the V1 cruise ship missile which come right before it, the V3 Cannon was the huge tremendous rifle. It actually was set up directly into a slope and was efficient at firing weaponry seashells from France to Central london across the English language Route. The V3 Cannon operated as stated by multi-demand standards when the secondary propellant charges seemed to be fired first to boost the projectiles steadily given that they relocated over the barrels in the cannon. The V3 was able to drive seashells to a length of 93 mls. </p>  <p>The next weapon used in The Second World War was the Dora and Gustav Rail Cannons. These 32.5-\" grade cannons were being unquestionably behemoths. In general, these canons were the biggest cannons that the whole planet has ever in your life observed. These folks were so huge that each one needed to be sent in numerous articles, established, and finally be mounted on a nicely-completely ready emplacement. This whole practice called for about 4,000 gentlemen! The penetrative potency for this seashells that weighed 11,000 excess weight was a <a href=\"http://essayonlinewriter.com/write-my-essay/\">http://essayonlinewriter.com/write-my-essay/</a> good amount of to abolish an ammunition put safeguarded by anywhere up to 100 foot of rock and roll. Tool professionals similar to Alexander Ludeke known as cannons “technological works of art.” But nevertheless, he applied they were a good deal of waste material of materials, effort, and electronic competency. </p>  <p>One of the The Second World War weaponry was the Unrotated Projectile. It was just one of the hints that checked plausible in writing, but proven awful when insert to practice. The Unrotated Projectile was actually a British creativity that comprised of a shorter array of rocket-firing contra --aircraft missile with suffered from wire connections and parachutes placed on it. The objective pertaining to the whole set of innovations would be to come up with an aerial minefield. As being the rockets over time drifted back, almost every other aircraft piloting through the entire position spot will probably be of remarkable probability of catching a cable television that might take the rocket in direction of it and explode on have an impact on. The highest hassle was a small enhance of wind flow posed the danger of rendering the rocket drift to return on the same cruise ship that brought out them. </p>  <p>Finally, the warfare discovered a tool referred to as the Goliath-tracked mine. The tool got its start through Allies and was actually a far off-taken care of demolition provider. It was initially introduced by the Germans that year 1942 to use to transport a 166 lb bomb to goals together with tanks, bridges, thick infantry formations, and complexes. These electric motor equipment ended up wire-controlled, and in addition they erupted on connection with their concentrates on. Unluckily, on the Germans, the cars or trucks was sluggish, very difficult to charge, and then the payloads happen to be excessively smallish. Since it ended up, the idea was ahead of its time simply because it became a precursor into the trendy robots. Even so, technological innovations by then was not that advanced.</p>  <p>To summarize, the next Marketplace War was the battleground to present the superiority of numerous highly effective regions with regard to military expertise.

It was subsequently not until his passing away that more controlled notions about the spectrum obtained produced. The earlier research information coined by Huseyin Topdemir Gazi, the Persian physicist, asserted that your chosen rainbow may be a concentric group of friends that varieties regarding the axis of concave decorative mirrors. His way of thinking was started relating to the refraction and representation belonging to the sun rays (Filippenko and Leven, 2009). Plenty of trendy scientists used both these clinical rules in developing the rainbow development experiments. This evaluation focuses primarily on the dispersion, refraction, and reflection of lighter because fundamental activities involved in the structure with the spectrum.</p>  <p>The rainbow may be a multiple-shaded range of lighting meteorological and optical occurrence due to refraction and representation of lumination rays in moisture droplets. The formation in the spectrum takes place in 7 phases. During the first place, white-colored lumination manufactured by the sun endeavor the raindrops at an serious point of view previously any lighter spectrum styles (Dawkins and McKean, 2012). The slope from which the bright lumination sun rays belonging to the sunlight come to the droplets water from the atmosphere is necessary. It is because this can determine the route of your refracted and shown perspective sun rays shortly after showing up in the liquid surface, thus performing a decisive factor from the growth of your rainbow (Ahrens, 2013). </p>  <p>Another and therefore the next steps of this technological approach are reflection and refraction of the bright white gentle rays correspondingly. Being a window windows, mineral water shows and transmits light. If your whitened light-weight sun rays radiated by its direct sun light slammed fluids droplets around the atmosphere, a small fraction of these light source can get mirrored in accordance with the guidelines of representation (Filippenko and Leven, 2009). Some whitened soft rays get refracted, therefore crossing the environment-the water boundary covering. At the same time, they decelerate in rate considering the variations in moderate densities.

It was subsequently not until his passing away that more controlled notions about the spectrum obtained produced. The earlier research information coined by Huseyin Topdemir Gazi, the Persian physicist, asserted that your chosen rainbow may be a concentric group of friends that varieties regarding the axis of concave decorative mirrors. His way of thinking was started relating to the refraction and representation belonging to the sun rays (Filippenko and Leven, 2009). Plenty of trendy scientists used both these clinical rules in developing the rainbow development experiments. This evaluation focuses primarily on the dispersion, refraction, and reflection of lighter because fundamental activities involved in the structure with the spectrum.</p>  <p>The rainbow may be a multiple-shaded range of lighting meteorological and optical occurrence due to refraction and representation of lumination rays in moisture droplets. The formation in the spectrum takes place in 7 phases. During the first place, white-colored lumination manufactured by the sun endeavor the raindrops at an serious point of view previously any lighter spectrum styles (Dawkins and McKean, 2012). The slope from which the bright lumination sun rays belonging to the sunlight come to the droplets water from the atmosphere is necessary. It is because this can determine the route of your refracted and shown perspective sun rays shortly after showing up in the liquid surface, thus performing a decisive factor from the growth of your rainbow (Ahrens, 2013). </p>  <p>Another and therefore the next steps of this technological approach are reflection and refraction of the bright white gentle rays correspondingly. Being a window windows, mineral water shows and transmits light. If your whitened light-weight sun rays radiated by its direct sun light slammed fluids droplets around the atmosphere, a small fraction of these light source can get mirrored in accordance with the guidelines of representation (Filippenko and Leven, 2009).

These transforms allow the microorganisms to adapt in to the adjustments to the earth, thus living through. Modifications in your natural environment take two solutions. First of all, the actual environment from a localised zone adjustments gradually and also the microorganisms have a need to accommodate them to thrive. Additionally, organisms migrate from area to another one, specifically if the local area place is densely populated and unsustainable; some organisms migrate to new sparsely areas for emergency and sustainability (Lenomard, 2002). In these instances, the hereditary makeup products about the organisms changes in order to permit the organism to evolve in to the adjustment. </p>  <p>Inheritance</p>  <p>Considering that time immemorial, many people have never fail to believed that there exists a process that permits dads and moms to successfully pass their particular elements to their own young. When Charles Darwin launched the method of natural and organic selection, he postulated that there needs to be a mechanism that enables some organisms to live by way of transformations (Krukonis and Barr, 2011). This procedure was not effectively grasped up to the point Gregor Mendel revealed the concept of inheritance. Gregor, an Augustinian monk, became peas from the Monastery and analyzed them keenly to comprehend how they reproduced and handed down the extraordinary capabilities (genes), from your mom or dad on the offspring (Bardoe, 2006; Edelson, 2001). With exclusive target the Mendelian inherited genes, researchers respected what we were originally losing out on (genes) throughout the advancement operation. The genes and the way they transition (mutation) stated why some microorganisms survived thru corrections and more failed to (Bardoe, 2006). It more completely simplified how new microorganisms are produced. Within that respect, the Mendelian genetic makeup was the passing up on piece from the challenge of evolution; these are plans that assure inheritance with the fathers and mothers on to the young. </p>  <p>Realization</p>  <p>This newspaper reviewed the idea of progression for instance story, range, and inheritance.

These transforms allow the microorganisms to adapt in to the adjustments to the earth, thus living through. Modifications in your natural environment take two solutions. First of all, the actual environment from a localised zone adjustments gradually and also the microorganisms have a need to accommodate them to thrive. Additionally, organisms migrate from area to another one, specifically if the local area place is densely populated and unsustainable; some organisms migrate to new sparsely areas for emergency and sustainability (Lenomard, 2002). In these instances, the hereditary makeup products about the organisms changes in order to permit the organism to evolve in to the adjustment. </p>  <p>Inheritance</p>  <p>Considering that time immemorial, many people have never fail to believed that there exists a process that permits dads and moms to successfully pass their particular elements to their own young. When Charles Darwin launched the method of natural and organic selection, he postulated that there needs to be a mechanism that enables some organisms to live by way of transformations (Krukonis and Barr, 2011). This procedure was not effectively grasped up to the point Gregor Mendel revealed the concept of inheritance. Gregor, an Augustinian monk, became peas from the Monastery and analyzed them keenly to comprehend how they reproduced and handed down the extraordinary capabilities (genes), from your mom or dad on the offspring (Bardoe, 2006; Edelson, 2001). With exclusive target the Mendelian inherited genes, researchers respected what we were originally losing out on (genes) throughout the advancement operation. The genes and the way they transition (mutation) stated why some microorganisms survived thru corrections and more failed to (Bardoe, 2006). It more completely simplified how new microorganisms are produced. Within that respect, the Mendelian genetic makeup was the passing up on piece from the challenge of evolution; these are plans that assure inheritance with the fathers and mothers on to the young. </p>  <p>Realization</p>  <p>This newspaper reviewed the idea of progression for instance story, range, and inheritance. Progress is really a design in the modern world given it clearly shows how microorganisms greatly improved in <a href=\"http://researchpaperstar.com/\">http://researchpaperstar.com</a> the long run. The reasoning was initially introduced by Greek philosophers many thousands of years before. The community perceived this idea healthier shortly after Charles Darwin offered the technique of all-natural collection. It turned out to be even more clear right after the growth of the genetics because of the Augustine Monk, Gregor Mendel.</p>','Educational Pieces of paper Task in respect to the Nature herself of Development: Choice, Inheritance, and Story','','inherit','closed','closed','','457-revision-v1','','','2016-12-09 08:57:18','2016-12-09 08:57:18','',457,'http://startupbroker.gr/457-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(459,1,'2016-12-07 17:57:32','2016-12-07 17:57:32','Academic Essay Talking about Long term Difficulties of Heath Care Treatment Control  <p>Launch</p>  <p>As many different authorities make an effort to result in reforms inside of their medical care sectors, many concerns are likely to appear that might jeopardise the initiatives in order to gain excellent products.<!--more--> Medical organization in every nation is predicted to produce superior services to make sure that locals are shielded from health conditions and premature deaths.

There are many quarrels which were utilized to offer the boasts of global warming, which actually are cases and disputes that hold no surface. </p>  <p>Climate change is baseless while there is no legitimate substantiation the environmentally friendly apocalypse is gradually happening. More than 30,000 researchers have invalidated the unfounded advise that climate change is harmful the environment.

Likewise, Williams explained that the assertions heightened about world-wide conditions warming up seemed to be fallacious. The melting associated with the arctic is also one of the few unjustified states to promote the existence of global warming. The reality is, it has been acknowledged that simply because 2012, the arctic ice has dissolved by one half. Contrary to the unwarranted assertions about Arctic melting by 50 percent given that 2012, the European Space or room Firm (ESA) CryoSat satellite quest revealed evidence of the polar sea ice cubes is maximizing by 50 % from 2012 to 2013.

Huxley and Jean show, by x-ray diffraction that macromolecules size does not transformation for the period of muscle group shortening. The discoveries show that muscle discover tension and reduce in length, after a moving of myofilaments next to one another.

Insight on myocardial contractility illustrates totally different viewpoint that these essential regulator is potassium. Evidence due to this would be that inotrophic treatments is a result of the high charges of potassium efflux, which emanate from myocardium. Addititionally there is the study that huge levels of potassium restrict the viro connections of actin and myosin.

The 3rd cardstock more completely illustrates which the autonomic stimulation practice transformations the illustrations of last part-diastolic volume. </p>  <p> Sarnoff in 1955 demonstrates “family of Starling curves” that points out your relationship of; control through adjusting side-diastolic sound level about the contractility alterations. The knowledge points out that your updating contractile capabilities are significant in impacting on processes on the heart and soul. 10 years in the future, the myocardial contractility approach was more deeply illustrated by a studies throughout the fields of biochemistry along with biophysics. Huxley and Jean show, by x-ray diffraction that macromolecules size does not transformation for the period of muscle group shortening. The discoveries show that muscle discover tension and reduce in length, after a moving of myofilaments next to one another. The contractile hard work could depend on the interactions of go across-bridges created because of myosin and actin heads nestled from the the years filaments respectively. The adjustments experienced with the duration of the sacromere improve amount of excitation-contraction coupling. In 1960s, groundwork findings show that the calcium mineral increased the contractile healthy proteins throughout the skeletal muscle. The foremost producer with the activator calcium mineral will be the Sarcoplasmic Rectilum (SR). </p>  <p> Calcium supplements improves the excitation-contraction coupling. Insight on myocardial contractility illustrates totally different viewpoint that these essential regulator is potassium. Evidence due to this would be that inotrophic treatments is a result of the high charges of potassium efflux, which emanate from myocardium. Addititionally there is the study that huge levels of potassium restrict the viro connections of actin and myosin. However, Ringer found out that a higher level of extracellular potassium lowers core contraction, in an test taken care of on frogs. The studies positive effects <a href=\"https://www.levitradosageus24.com/buy-levitra-online-overnight-delivery/\">buy levitra online overnight delivery</a> have an effect on the alkali stainless steel iron inside of the excitability things in place of contractility. </p>  <p>Calcium supplements often is the essential influence within the <a href=\"https://www.levitradosageus24.com/levitra-link-online-rx/\">levitra link online rx</a> myocardial contractility <a href=\"http://paramountessays.com/\">http://paramountessays.com</a>, not potassium. The regulatory healthy proteins in the skinny filaments are major in making sure the micromolar concentrations of calcium supplements needed for influencing the contractile meats in vitro. Quite similar breakthrough discovery is at 1966, during the regulatory techniques of heart; for this reason elevating expertise and study on cardiac control. The 1960s studies have shown that cardiac SR supplies the capacity for the calcium thats generally to the troponin. The 1990s analyze illustrates the plasma membrane layer that transports out from the mobile phone; here is the calcium mineral transporter ATPase. The intercellular funnel functions inside the inner membranes; illustrates the ryanodine receptor. </p>  <p> Contractile necessary protein is a result of the downhill calcium supplements fluxes. Pleasure wants the improved upon uphill calcium supplement transfer inside Sarcoplasmic Rectilum and outside the cell phone. The data demonstrates that both the contraction and pleasure efforts want stamina. Electrical energy hunger negative effects at the lifestyle core is with the right concentrations of cytosolic ATP; which is between 5 and 10 mmol/L.</p>','Some expressions to the contraction and peacefulness of cardiac fibers in school posting cardstock','','inherit','closed','closed','','409-revision-v1','','','2016-12-11 06:17:41','2016-12-11 06:17:41','',409,'http://startupbroker.gr/409-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(468,1,'2016-12-12 08:15:39','2016-12-12 08:15:39','University or college Papepr Talking about The operation of Venture Development  <p>Beginning</p>  <p> Online business enlargement for some other areas and different countries is seen as a critical element of the actual growth methods of economic.<!--more--> Extension to localised markets are usually experienced as a result of relationships, franchising, certificates and alliances.

For instance, the us government folks spend more than $100 billion dollars to tend to in this article 4.5 zillion many people afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease (Lombardi, Schermerhorn, and Kramer, 2007).

The pace of enhance can occur in short-term stretches (micro-progress) or older long stretches (macro-progression) (Isaak, 2007, p.89; Ayala and Avise, p.294). The outcome of history are wide-ranging; could possibly be positive or detrimental to the organism dependant upon the result on the genome. Microorganisms that contain evolved as time goes by have done so though inheritance and natural assortment (Elsevier, 2007, p.83). Inheritance is the method which allows organisms to pass their special for the offspring. Then again, merely the effective stay alive within the improve (all-natural option), notably if there is an environmental transform. Numerous microorganisms get used to the the environmental transitions in a different way; some pull through other types usually do not (collection). This pieces of paper will discuss the character of advancement with special aim for assortment, inheritance, and heritage. </p>  <p>Heritage</p>  <p>Although many progress theorists additionally, the world credit rating Charles Darwin given that the firstly man to get the challenge of evolution to lighting, historic Ancient greek philosophers postulated that there was growth of whole life from low-dwelling items. In addition, the traditional Ancient greek Philosopher, Anaximander stated that there was an progression of gentleman from family pets (Tips on Research, n.d). This way of thinking did not make a great deal sensation those times. In actual fact, the theory of history put together a great deal more real sense when Charles Darwin investigated more on it. Charles Darwin first unveiled the technique of natural choices, which has been not wise, but was realistic checking out the historical timelines of organisms (Information on Technology, n.d). </p>  <p>Variety</p>  <p>In accordance Elsevier (2007), genuine assortment is the method by which exactly the robust microorganisms stay alive from green modifications to the advancement method. Krukonis and Barr (2011), declare that organic and natural decision will require modifications to the genome of organisms. These transforms allow the microorganisms to adapt in to the adjustments to the earth, thus living through. Modifications in your natural environment take two solutions. First of all, the actual environment from a localised zone adjustments gradually and also the microorganisms have a need to accommodate them to thrive. Additionally, organisms migrate from area to another one, specifically if the local area place is densely populated and unsustainable; some organisms migrate to new sparsely areas for emergency and sustainability (Lenomard, 2002). In these instances, the hereditary makeup products about the organisms changes in order to permit the organism to evolve in to the adjustment. </p>  <p>Inheritance</p>  <p>Considering that time immemorial, many people have never fail to believed that there exists a process that permits dads and moms to successfully pass their particular elements to their own young. When Charles Darwin launched the method of natural and organic selection, he postulated that there needs to be a mechanism that enables some organisms to live by way of transformations (Krukonis and Barr, 2011). This procedure was not effectively grasped up to the point Gregor Mendel revealed the concept of inheritance. Gregor, an Augustinian monk, became peas from the Monastery and analyzed them keenly to comprehend how they reproduced and handed down the extraordinary capabilities (genes), from your mom or dad on the offspring (Bardoe, 2006; Edelson, 2001). With exclusive target the Mendelian inherited genes, researchers respected what we were originally losing out on (genes) throughout the advancement operation. The genes and the way they transition (mutation) stated why some microorganisms survived thru corrections and more failed to (Bardoe, 2006). It more completely simplified how new microorganisms are produced. Within that respect, the Mendelian genetic makeup was the passing up on piece from the challenge of evolution; these are plans that assure inheritance with the fathers and mothers on to the young. </p>  <p>Realization</p>  <p>This newspaper reviewed the idea of progression for instance story, range, and inheritance. Progress is really a design in the modern world given it clearly shows how microorganisms greatly improved in <a href=\"http://researchpaperstar.com/\">http://researchpaperstar.com</a> the long run. The reasoning was initially introduced by Greek philosophers many thousands of years before. The community perceived this idea healthier shortly after Charles Darwin offered the technique of all-natural collection.

It was subsequently not until his passing away that more controlled notions about the spectrum obtained produced. The earlier research information coined by Huseyin Topdemir Gazi, the Persian physicist, asserted that your chosen rainbow may be a concentric group of friends that varieties regarding the axis of concave decorative mirrors. His way of thinking was started relating to the refraction and representation belonging to the sun rays (Filippenko and Leven, 2009). Plenty of trendy scientists used both these clinical rules in developing the rainbow development experiments. This evaluation focuses primarily on the dispersion, refraction, and reflection of lighter because fundamental activities involved in the structure with the spectrum.</p>  <p>The rainbow may be a multiple-shaded range of lighting meteorological and optical occurrence due to refraction and representation of lumination rays in moisture droplets. The formation in the spectrum takes place in 7 phases. During the first place, white-colored lumination manufactured by the sun endeavor the raindrops at an serious point of view previously any lighter spectrum styles (Dawkins and McKean, 2012). The slope from which the bright lumination sun rays belonging to the sunlight come to the droplets water from the atmosphere is necessary. It is because this can determine the route of your refracted and shown perspective sun rays shortly after showing up in the liquid surface, thus performing a decisive factor from the growth of your rainbow (Ahrens, 2013). </p>  <p>Another and therefore the next steps of this technological approach are reflection and refraction of the bright white gentle rays correspondingly. Being a window windows, mineral water shows and transmits light. If your whitened light-weight sun rays radiated by its direct sun light slammed fluids droplets around the atmosphere, a small fraction of these light source can get mirrored in accordance with the guidelines of representation (Filippenko and Leven, 2009). Some whitened soft rays get refracted, therefore crossing the environment-the water boundary covering. At the same time, they decelerate in rate considering the variations in moderate densities. So, the sunlight journey bends when coming into a denser boundary - an operation generally known as refraction of mild. It is really this twisting for the bright white light when it comes to the standard series that gets aimed to the attention among the observer (Norris, 2012).</p>  <p>The fourth point necessitates the splitting on the whitened light into six piece tones. Ahrens (2013) identified that white-colored lightweight is actually a scope a variety of styles and wavelengths. They comprise of red-colored, orange, yellow, eco-friendly, light blue, indigo, and violet (ROYGBIV). Depending upon their wavelengths, these tones have distinct rates if they journey in one average to another of various densities. Its these disparities in densities that define their degrees of dispersion. At the same time, the rainbow continues concealed at the viewer unless total inside reflection transpires. This occurs throughout the 5th step of rainbow formation. In that place, the white sunshine hits the raindrop area around the occurrence position that is higher than the theoretical necessary angle (Dawkins and McKean, 2012). </p>  <p>The last two steps are two times refraction and further dispersion of these lightweight spectrums. The pace on the white-colored lumination fluctuations repeatedly for any 2nd time as it results in the raindrop boundary. Considering it goes into a lighter in weight channel (air), its pace raises therefore should get refracted outside the defined everyday line. Every one part of the white-colored perspective is farther dispersed determined by its wavelengths, thus forming a circle arc. The red lighting will get refracted outside the traditional range at the steeper position in accordance with the glowing <a href=\"http://www.cialispharmaciefr24.com/cialis-40-mg-pas-cher/\">cialis 40 mg pas cher</a> blue lighter (Ahrens, 2013). This is for this reason your crimson sunshine can get directed to the eye of your observer status in an extreme direction to the floor. The blue light-weight is instructed at obtuse direction using a trajectory direction that travels across the scalp among the observer (Norris, 2012). Because <a href=http://customessaywriter.co.uk/>www.customessaywriter.co.uk/</a> of this , the reddish colored and blue colored lights are viewed towards the top and base of your rainbow respectively. </p>  <p>Therefore, the formation on the rainbow is one of the controlled techniques which all have remained dubious. While you are Aristotle offered the most important principle outlining its formation, it picked up dismissed in the membership it was actually a more qualitative handle. But, most analysts relied on this principle to advance scientifically demonstrated information over the growth among the rainbow. There exist about three systems mixed up in growth of your rainbow. Included in this are reflection, refraction, and dispersion within the bright soft, and that is a variety of seven light-weight rays of various colorings. Before the spectrum develops, the bright white illumination radiated with the sun and fluids droplets has to are in existence. Based upon their wavelengths, distinct aspects of the light brightness get dispersed and refracted at distinctive angles from the traditional lines, consequently the formation in the spectrum. </p>','The Explanation of a Growth of a Rainbow in University Document','','inherit','closed','closed','','431-revision-v1','','','2016-12-15 13:59:37','2016-12-15 13:59:37','',431,'http://startupbroker.gr/431-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(494,1,'2016-12-15 15:02:08','2016-12-15 15:02:08','University or college Papepr Talking about The operation of Venture Development  <p>Beginning</p>  <p> Online business enlargement for some other areas and different countries is seen as a critical element of the actual growth methods of economic.<!--more--> Extension to localised markets are usually experienced as a result of relationships, franchising, certificates and alliances.

How they transfer cash flow could also be shocking.

Endeavours are now being developed to stem the move of money amongst terrorist organizations, but it surely need to be the leading stage of emphasis. No matter how the majority of terrorists are killed, there\'ll always be an additional soldier to require his place as long as these organizations have revenue. Over and above just staying accustomed to purchase assaults, terrorists use quite a bit of their funding to unfold their evil information and recruit new soldiers. Provided that they however have access to revenue, terrorists will likely to be able to continue their mission. Stopping terror 100 % is most likely not a practical goal. There\'ll always be evil many people on this planet, and there will at all times be young, impressionable minds for the people folks to indoctrinate. Controlling terror is really a so much more practical plan. This may be accomplished by for starters turning into experts on terrorism. It is not an enemy that could be pointed out of a lineup.

Charges of War scientists at Brown University estimate the prices in the war on terror at four.4 trillion.  Irrespective of the massive amount of debate and resources which were poured in the work to regulate and forestall world wide terrorism, terrorists go on <a href=\"http://buyessay.net/coursework-writing\">buyessay.net/coursework-writing</a> to take innocent life with a regular foundation. Terrorism is definitely an unconventional enemy. In order to defeat it, unconventional means really should be put to use. The techniques required to prevent terrorism are economic and political in mother nature, in lieu of militaristic. A method that focuses on economic and political coverage will remedy the illness of terrorism versus dealing with the indications with navy initiatives.</p> <p>Methods to forestall terrorism will need to just take into account the fact that there exists certain political climates through which terrorism seems to prosper. The united states has built a habit of interfering with authoritarian regimes. Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan are one of the newest. In a very paper entitled “Poverty, Political Independence, as well as the Roots of Terrorism,” Alberto Abadie concluded that there\'s an “observed increase in terrorism for international locations in changeover from authoritarian regimes to democracies.”  What Abadie’s conclusions show is without doubt one of the huge things leading to terrorism often is the new function from the America given that the world’s police force. This place is simply hindsight for your up-to-date position from the Center East. Regimes have currently been toppled and an item has to get maintain in their destination, however the results of interference must be rigorously taken into account around the future. Absolutely, the U.S. are unable to stand by whilst authoritarian regimes perpetrate gross injustices on their own many people, nonetheless American authorities ought to properly weigh these conclusions and recognise that political unrest typically prospects to terrorism. Terrorism is really a virus which reproduces seemingly without end, specifically in regions of political unrest, so it ought to be lower off in the resource.

Terrorists never have to have giant armed service installations or supply strains that could be specific similar to a classic opponent. All they really want is money and folks. How they transfer cash flow could also be shocking. In his e-book, Unfunding Terror: the Legal Reaction towards Funding of world Terrorism, Jimmy Gurul states, “Contrary to favored perception, terrorists use banking institutions together with other money institutions to transfer resources.” Gurul goes on to debate the numerous positive aspects provided into the terrorists through products and services this sort of as wire transfer.  Endeavours are now being developed to stem the move of money amongst terrorist organizations, but it surely need to be the leading stage of emphasis. No matter how the majority of terrorists are killed, there\'ll always be an additional soldier to require his place as long as these organizations have revenue. Over and above just staying accustomed to purchase assaults, terrorists use quite a bit of their funding to unfold their evil information and recruit new soldiers. Provided that they however have access to revenue, terrorists will likely to be able to continue their mission. Stopping terror 100 % is most likely not a practical goal. There\'ll always be evil many people on this planet, and there will at all times be young, impressionable minds for the people folks to indoctrinate.

Charges of War scientists at Brown University estimate the prices in the war on terror at four.4 trillion.  Irrespective of the massive amount of debate and resources which were poured in the work to regulate and forestall world wide terrorism, terrorists go on <a href=\"http://buyessay.net/coursework-writing\">buyessay.net/coursework-writing</a> to take innocent life with a regular foundation. Terrorism is definitely an unconventional enemy. In order to defeat it, unconventional means really should be put to use. The techniques required to prevent terrorism are economic and political in mother nature, in lieu of militaristic. A method that focuses on economic and political coverage will remedy the illness of terrorism versus dealing with the indications with navy initiatives.</p> <p>Methods to forestall terrorism will need to just take into account the fact that there exists certain political climates through which terrorism seems to prosper. The united states has built a habit of interfering with authoritarian regimes. Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan are one of the newest. In a very paper entitled “Poverty, Political Independence, as well as the Roots of Terrorism,” Alberto Abadie concluded that there\'s an “observed increase in terrorism for international locations in changeover from authoritarian regimes to democracies.”  What Abadie’s conclusions show is without doubt one of the huge things leading to terrorism often is the new function from the America given that the world’s police force. This place is simply hindsight for your up-to-date position from the Center East. Regimes have currently been toppled and an item has to get maintain in their destination, however the results of interference must be rigorously taken into account around the future. Absolutely, the U.S. are unable to stand by whilst authoritarian regimes perpetrate gross injustices on their own many people, nonetheless American authorities ought to properly weigh these conclusions and recognise that political unrest typically prospects to terrorism. Terrorism is really a virus which reproduces seemingly without end, specifically in regions of political unrest, so it ought to be lower off in the resource. Military strikes by on their own would be the equal to enjoying a not ever ending video game of whack-a-mole. Terrorists never have to have giant armed service installations or supply strains that could be specific similar to a classic opponent. All they really want is money and folks. How they transfer cash flow could also be shocking. In his e-book, Unfunding Terror: the Legal Reaction towards Funding of world Terrorism, Jimmy Gurul states, “Contrary to favored perception, terrorists use banking institutions together with other money institutions to transfer resources.” Gurul goes on to debate the numerous positive aspects provided into the terrorists through products and services this sort of as wire transfer.  Endeavours are now being developed to stem the move of money amongst terrorist organizations, but it surely need to be the leading stage of emphasis. No matter how the majority of terrorists are killed, there\'ll always be an additional soldier to require his place as long as these organizations have revenue. Over and above just staying accustomed to purchase assaults, terrorists use quite a bit of their funding to unfold their evil information and recruit new soldiers. Provided that they however have access to revenue, terrorists will likely to be able to continue their mission. Stopping terror 100 % is most likely not a practical goal. There\'ll always be evil many people on this planet, and there will at all times be young, impressionable minds for the people folks to indoctrinate. Controlling terror is really a so much more practical plan. This may be accomplished by for starters turning into experts on terrorism. It is not an enemy that could be pointed out of a lineup. Terrorism has a wide selection of varying faces. Attempting to label it and set it within a box is counterproductive. Realizing just where and when it can be almost certainly to occur allows for preventative measures for being place set up just before it\'s a chance to proliferate. In the similar token, the reality that terrorism has lots of a number of faces usually means that preventative actions will want to become unconventional and impressive. Traditional approaches don\'t have any put in opposition to an enemy that operates without boundaries.</p>','Controlling World-wide Terrorism','','inherit','closed','closed','','542-revision-v1','','','2017-01-03 11:26:23','2017-01-03 11:26:23','',542,'http://startupbroker.gr/542-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(544,1,'2016-06-29 12:47:36','2016-06-29 12:47:36','How to handle it when you need to obtain essay internet?  <p><strong>Description</strong>: If you would like buy an essay online, everything you should do is to discover businesses that will sell it.

What will be steered? <p>Global terrorism is often quoted as a particular from the biggest would-be cause for Entire world War three to happen.<!--more--> It happens to be also explained as being the black confront of humanity inside of the 21st Century. In my opinion World-wide Terrorism can be an unnatural technique for expression of anger and in turn warmth. The equation resulting in world terrorism is very basic: Food stuff loaded with highest possible proteins + comparatively decreased degree of physical exercise + Stagnant Jobs = Storage of excess warmth within the human body.   The query which regularly intrigues me is - a hundred a long time back we ended up consuming he same meals, cooked in essentially similar way. Then why a lot of extra heat. But then I emphasis to your latter a part of the equation. Lack of adequate exercise and stagnant work opportunities <a href=\"http://essaywhales.com/Services/write-an-outstanding-comparison-essay-today\">the source</a>. Roughly a one hundred years ago, the operating design and style was sweat loaded. Now it\'s got altered to sweat f-r-e-e, motion 100 percent free do the job more than more than 7 hrs. Here is the factor that all those additional warmth developing proteins get accrued inside our system. Scientifically, the human human body accepts supplementary warmth only to the several amount. After that the thoughts is mechanically stimulated to consider tips for getting this unwanted heat outside of your body. Unfortunately, due to parental and societal pressures on small children and children, the initial gateway for this warmth develops into violence. </p> <p>We commonly observe that folks in these modern times grievance in their young people currently being abusive, disrespectful in addition to physically violent. The solution in for this problem lies in switching from the gaming console and sending the children Outside the house to participate in. But how can we connect this to intercontinental terrorism? It truly is relatively easy to understand. Some of these “over-heated” kids usually get into midnight brawls, road rows and stuff. In these kinds of events they get their heroes - the lousy men (For them, “the fascinating guys”). It really is quite often explained that excellent business enterprise is the best present it is easy to request. The precise reverse of the situation is bringing about world terrorism. These minimal pockets of “cool fellas groups” get along with the delightful device of social media marketing the Internet has furnished them. Such starts the vicious circle of terrorist activities.  Extremist nations frequently use these strong and violent teams to secretly assault their enemies. The best way to assault the enemy is to weaken it internally.

It is really sometimes said that effective small business is the best present you\'ll be able to request. The precise reverse of the problem is bringing about world-wide terrorism. These modest pockets of “cool guys groups” get along with the great tool of social media the World-wide-web has delivered them. Like starts the vicious circle of terrorist activities.  Extremist nations sometimes use these robust and violent teams to secretly assault their enemies. The obvious way to attack the enemy can be to weaken it internally.

I\'m not blaming your mums and dads! Neither am I blaming mine! I wish to change the friends and family program by which we dwell at the moment. I have a friend in Germany.

But my concern would be that the friends and family satisfy only on Christmas and Thanksgiving. six women and men with the very same loved ones, living in 4 numerous houses, estranged from one another. Is that this what we simply call friends and family? From the adamant urge to are living independently, we have now neglected the sweetness of simply being dependent. We\'ve got neglected the adore we get, when a person waits for us to consume and slumber. And because of to this fad of living individually, we give rise into a two sided sword referred to as - individualism. This individualism more often than not results in burial of emotions. Even the considered family members irritates us to our core. And this results in Psychological Demise. The fact is, fifty percent of us emotionally lifeless. These emotionally useless minds tend to be easier to brainwash. Terrorist teams do not ever goal children living in households and guarded environments. Since this kind of many people are emotionally hooked up, and so it\'s not at all effortless to brainwash them. They typically focus on men and women who will be residing on their own very own. Every one of the loners. Now, how you can counter this issue?  An historic stating goes like: “The most troublesome obstacle has the only option.” And for this friends and family trouble you will find a four letter choice called - Absolutely adore! Adore your family and liked your family members. Smile, god loves you, keep smiling, the whole world will way too.

Now it\'s transformed to sweat no cost, movement free operate in excess of greater than 7 hours. This can be the factor that these additional heat producing proteins get accumulated within our human body. Scientifically, the human whole body accepts additional heat only to the some amount. After that the mind is automatically stimulated to consider hints to obtain this avoidable heat outside of your body. The sad thing is, owing to parental and societal pressures on boys and girls and children, the primary gateway for this heat gets violence. </p> <p>We often observe that oldsters lately complaint in their kids to be abusive, disrespectful and likewise physically violent. The answer in for this problem lies in switching from the gaming console and sending the kids Outdoors to enjoy. But how can we join this to world wide terrorism? It is actually particularly relatively easy. Several of these “over-heated” kids often enter into midnight brawls, road rows and things. In like occasions they get their heroes - the dreadful guys (For them, “the awesome guys”). Its all too often reported that superior business is the greatest present it\'s possible to request. The precise opposite of the circumstance is bringing about world-wide terrorism. These minor pockets of “cool men groups” get along with the delightful instrument of social networking which the World wide web has delivered them. These types of commences the vicious circle of terrorist functions.  Extremist nations sometimes use these dynamic and violent groups to secretly attack their enemies. The best way to attack the enemy is to always weaken it internally. Terrorists gradually turned out to be an asset on the drug mafias and deal killer gangs. It is always extremely amusing that every one this can be connected to the morsel of meat that you just could be chewing right now and your laziness to move your physique each and every day! So how can we solve this issue? Convenient - Change Your Food Behavior, Listen to Your Grandma, and obtain Out and Training! </p> <p>Thus the foodstuff we try to eat is without doubt one of the important reasons bringing about world-wide terrorism. However it is not the only real motive driving it. We want to change and completely transform a couple of way more things. The next thing which comes to my head, is Friends and family Values. No! I am not blaming your mother and father! Neither am I blaming mine! I want to alter the family plan during which we reside at this time. I\'ve a friend in Germany. She’s 38 a long time aged, single. She lives in Berlin. Her brother lives along with his husband in the same exact city. Her young sister is divorced twice also life there. And guess where their 80 calendar year aged parent reside? In BERLIN! Residing independent just isn\'t a problem for them. It\'s always their personal preference and i concur. But my complication would be that the loved ones meet up with only on Christmas and Thanksgiving. 6 men and women belonging to the exact same loved ones, living in 4 a variety of properties, estranged from each other. Is that this what we simply call family? Inside adamant urge to dwell independently, now we have neglected the sweetness of staying dependent. We\'ve neglected the take pleasure in we get, when anyone waits for us to eat and snooze. And owing to this fad of residing separately, we give increase to a two sided sword referred to as - individualism. This individualism in many instances leads to burial of thoughts. Even the considered spouse and children irritates us to our core. Which leads to Emotional Demise. <a href=\"http://buyessays.com.au/compare-and-contrast-essay\">buyessays.com.au/compare-and-contrast-essay</a> Sadly i must say, fifty percent of us emotionally dead. These kinds of emotionally useless minds are much simpler to brainwash. Terrorist teams never ever target children residing in families and guarded environments. Because these types of women and men are emotionally connected, and so it isn\'t very simple to brainwash them. They at all times target folks who will be residing on their individual. All of the loners. Now, the right way to counter this issue?  An historical indicating goes like: “The most tricky drawback has the only answer.” And for this spouse and children drawback you will find a 4 letter alternative referred to as - Absolutely love! Have a passion for all your family members and beloved your family members. Smile, god loves you, hold smiling, the whole world will much too.  	While studying for this document, I looked into countless reviews and formulas to curb world terrorism. But once you go to the deep of it, it really is just Very good home-made foodstuff & Fancy!

Moving Effective Attributes derived from one of Group to another one.<!--more-->  <p>As time passes, microorganisms are believed to have emerged using their simple and easy design in their recent involved states in the usa. A number of ideas have always been more advanced in looking to show you a brief history of such a approach. The assumption that group tend to be shifting gradually remnants its roots within the Roman, Asian, middle age Islamic, and early Ancient greek scientific discipline (Chippindale, 2011). Both of them foremost practices which have ruled this approach are probably the Lamarckism and Darwinism. However totally different, the 2 basics are created on silky inheritance and pure option functions that call for switching advantageous traits within one technology to another one.</p>  <p>The most important evolutionary way of thinking found suggested by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck all through the 1800s. The Lamarckism concept found founded on the concept of transform from use and disuse. Due to the fact life is by no means set, organisms are made to change their heroes and behaviours to survive on the always modifying settings (Bentley and Maschner, 2010). To explain this concept, Lamarck chosen the instance of giraffes. According to the “use and disuse” evolutionary hypothesis, steady by using figure body organs causes them to be additional flexible for success. In contrast, the very least employed organs get smaller in the long term. The need to expand their necks for ‘nervous fluids’ crafted giraffes grown long necks. The Lamarckian Inheritance, also called silky inheritance, requires the transmit of purchased traits to the next generations (Dilek, 2013).</p>  <p>A second superb evolution principle is this : innovative in 1858 by Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin. In their own 1st publication “On the Origin of Species”, they asserted that a variety of species revealed a regular ancestor and descent (Kluver, 2012). The Darwin’s evolutionary concept <a href=\"http://assignmenthelponline.co.uk/\">http://assignmenthelponline.co.uk/</a> bought established on the very idea of natural assortment. This principle assumes that microorganisms which include wildlife, fishes, and greenery take a frequent ancestor (Chippindale, 2011). Different from the Lamarckism, this way of thinking assumes the progress of everyday living from low-being microorganisms. It is created using a strictly undirected (naturalistic) descent with improvements. In keeping with this principle, as stochastic genetic mutations occurred, essential features obtained kept and inherited through the offspring as they definitely aid their emergency probabilities (Scott, 2014).</p>  <p>The Darwin’s progress way of thinking, which is called the ‘Natural Selection’, is considered the youngest archetypes. But, the very idea of evolution extends back towards fifteenth century when Anaximander (a Greek philosopher) postulated the progression and expansion of existence from wildlife and low-living microorganisms (Bentley and Maschner, 2010). Because of this, Darwin’s theory was only but an advancement of the old theories explaining the foundation of mankind. The ‘natural selection’ hypothesis works to accumulate and retain insignificant beneficial genetic inversions.

Moving Effective Attributes derived from one of Group to another one.<!--more-->  <p>As time passes, microorganisms are believed to have emerged using their simple and easy design in their recent involved states in the usa. A number of ideas have always been more advanced in looking to show you a brief history of such a approach. The assumption that group tend to be shifting gradually remnants its roots within the Roman, Asian, middle age Islamic, and early Ancient greek scientific discipline (Chippindale, 2011). Both of them foremost practices which have ruled this approach are probably the Lamarckism and Darwinism. However totally different, the 2 basics are created on silky inheritance and pure option functions that call for switching advantageous traits within one technology to another one.</p>  <p>The most important evolutionary way of thinking found suggested by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck all through the 1800s. The Lamarckism concept found founded on the concept of transform from use and disuse. Due to the fact life is by no means set, organisms are made to change their heroes and behaviours to survive on the always modifying settings (Bentley and Maschner, 2010). To explain this concept, Lamarck chosen the instance of giraffes. According to the “use and disuse” evolutionary hypothesis, steady by using figure body organs causes them to be additional flexible for success. In contrast, the very least employed organs get smaller in the long term. The need to expand their necks for ‘nervous fluids’ crafted giraffes grown long necks. The Lamarckian Inheritance, also called silky inheritance, requires the transmit of purchased traits to the next generations (Dilek, 2013).</p>  <p>A second superb evolution principle is this : innovative in 1858 by Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin. In their own 1st publication “On the Origin of Species”, they asserted that a variety of species revealed a regular ancestor and descent (Kluver, 2012). The Darwin’s evolutionary concept <a href=\"http://assignmenthelponline.co.uk/\">http://assignmenthelponline.co.uk/</a> bought established on the very idea of natural assortment. This principle assumes that microorganisms which include wildlife, fishes, and greenery take a frequent ancestor (Chippindale, 2011). Different from the Lamarckism, this way of thinking assumes the progress of everyday living from low-being microorganisms. It is created using a strictly undirected (naturalistic) descent with improvements. In keeping with this principle, as stochastic genetic mutations occurred, essential features obtained kept and inherited through the offspring as they definitely aid their emergency probabilities (Scott, 2014).</p>  <p>The Darwin’s progress way of thinking, which is called the ‘Natural Selection’, is considered the youngest archetypes. But, the very idea of evolution extends back towards fifteenth century when Anaximander (a Greek philosopher) postulated the progression and expansion of existence from wildlife and low-living microorganisms (Bentley and Maschner, 2010). Because of this, Darwin’s theory was only but an advancement of the old theories explaining the foundation of mankind. The ‘natural selection’ hypothesis works to accumulate and retain insignificant beneficial genetic inversions. Reported by this idea, operational many advantages brought to life by the forefathers get handed down by their young. These beneficial qualities get transferred with the generations to come to reinforce their possibilities of surviving in stiffly competitive settings (Scott, 2014). However, features regarded inferior (disadvantageous) usually are not approved on the then several years as their ability to thrive are going to be constrained, as a result the extinction for the disadvantaged microorganisms from the ecosystem (Richards, 2013).</p>  <p>In the end, the technique of evolution can be as past the creation scenario.

But my drawback would be that the family unit satisfy only on Xmas and Thanksgiving. 6 citizens for the same exact spouse and children, residing in four several homes, estranged from each other. Is this what we phone spouse and children? Inside adamant urge to reside independently, we\'ve got overlooked the sweetness of staying dependent. We have overlooked the absolutely adore we get, when anyone waits for us to consume and snooze. And because of to this trend of living separately, we give increase into a two sided sword referred to as - individualism. This individualism usually leads to burial of emotions. Even the considered spouse and children irritates us to our core. Which brings about Psychological Death. Unfortunately, 50 percent of us emotionally dead. This kind of emotionally lifeless minds are much easier to brainwash. Terrorist groups practically never concentrate on youngsters residing in families and protected environments. Due to the fact that this sort of buyers are emotionally attached, and therefore it\'s not necessarily trouble-free to brainwash them. They generally goal men and women that are living on their own unique. Every one of the loners. Now, the best ways to counter this issue?

On one occasion these seem to have been evaluated, past labor and top notch activities in useful industries get examined. Above and beyond these a few task assortment components, Asian organisations examine the evaluation scores of possibilities people. Additionally, they appraise the ethnic and environment perception of their staff, an aspect this is absent during the United States’ collection processes (Martinez-Lucio, 2014). </p>  <p>Productivity appraisal is probably among the leadership methods which get put to use in calculating the results of business, separate, or organization goals and objectives. This program is focused towards distinguishing the challenges that could possibly impact on the production in the labor drive. Due to the fact different countries have varied fiscal dreams, employers in these cities implement divergent presentation assessment solutions (Andresen and Christian, 2014). This issues may very well be evidenced based on the event belonging to the U.S. and Asia. In the united states, productivity assessment is definitely a consequence influenced plan geared towards supporting personalized results and realizing greater labor production. This our websites managers program is deemed as the ways of recording the efficiency on the staff. Unlike the <a href=\"http://bestessaysforsale.net/\">essay writers for money</a> united states, this managing device is regarded unimportant with the Eastern companies. This is because of their inherent organizational structures. As a replacement, they treasure personal properties and ethical factors like for example obedience and devotion. With your focus increasingly being on punishments and success, functionality appraisal software can be ineffective in Asia (Warner, 2011).</p>  <p>Now, the necessity of improving the skill sets and capacities from the effort force from schooling is stressed by a lot of associations across the world. While crucial, firms allot different varieties of moolah to assist this workout. Whilst Asian different countries (except Japan) commit about $359 in each staff, employers in the united states allot near to $724 for every staff member on education and ability evolution (Andresen and Christian, 2014). Also, just how many guidance hours for each staff varies substantially involving the US and Asia. Martocchio (2013) demonstrated that not like Eastern businesses, US suppliers allot more lengthy exercise sessions each year. Even with these personal and time variations in employees’ working out, the differences into the outcomes are statistically unimportant as each potential employers envision an improvement within the specialized potential of their total workforce (Martinez-Lucio, 2014). </p>  <p>Therefore, it will be confirmed that Chinese suppliers and then the US adopt dissimilar human resource administration properties. Environmental and cultural dissimilarities anywhere between both these destinations have pressured companies to change their leadership tactics so as to accommodate inherent and diversified job societal designs. These sort of issues were verified in work force training, recruiting, and satisfaction appraisal tactics implemented by way of the recruiters. Although the HRM measures of your US are usually more productive and preferable over those of China, all of the two designs have his or her own weaknesses.</p>','Informational Essay Creating which E-books You into Human Resource Control in the usa and The far east','','inherit','closed','closed','','782-revision-v1','','','2017-01-25 09:09:33','2017-01-25 09:09:33','',782,'http://startupbroker.gr/782-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(784,1,'2017-01-18 10:01:11','2017-01-18 10:01:11','<p>Dissertation Paper Structure, Outline and What Is the Dissertation Statement <p><h1 <a href=\"http://bestgrammar-checker.com/\">checking grammar</a> align=\"center\"> Why Use grammarservices.com?</h1> <p>English is the language of universal communication , and we all speak English regularly for &nbsp;achieving their aims.

It really is quite often said that superior organisation is the greatest reward you can easily ask for. The precise reverse of this scenario is bringing about global terrorism. These minor pockets of “cool fellas groups” get along with the great resource of social media which the Web has supplied them. This kind of starts off the vicious circle of terrorist routines.  Extremist nations generally use these dynamic and violent teams to secretly attack their enemies. The best way to assault the enemy will be to weaken it internally. Terrorists slowly get an asset with the drug mafias and contract killer gangs. It is always very amusing that each one this can be connected to the morsel of meat that you just is perhaps chewing immediately along with your laziness to maneuver your physique everyday! So how do we fix this problem? Convenient - Transform Your Meals Patterns, Hear Your Grandma, and get Out and Physical exercise! </p> <p>Thus the food stuff we consume is without doubt one of the significant motives bringing about world terrorism. However it is not the only justification at the rear of it. We\'d like to change and completely transform a couple of further issues. The second element which concerns my thoughts, is Family members Values. No! I\'m not blaming your parents or guardians! Neither am I blaming mine! I wish to vary the family members program where we are living now. I\'ve an acquaintance in Germany. She’s 38 several years previous, single. She life in Berlin. Her brother lives along with his partner inside identical town. Her more youthful sister is divorced two times also life there. And guess just where their 80 calendar year outdated parent live? In BERLIN! Residing independent is not really a concern for them. It is always their particular selection and that i agree. But my drawback would be that the relatives meet up with only on Christmas and Thanksgiving. 6 individuals from the identical family members, residing in 4 distinct homes, estranged from one another. Is that this what we get in touch with relatives? During the adamant urge to live independently, we now have neglected the sweetness of being dependent. We have forgotten the like we get, when somebody waits for us to consume and slumber. And because of to this craze of dwelling independently, we give increase to the two sided sword described as - individualism. This individualism all too often contributes to burial of thoughts. Even the thought of family members irritates us to our main. Which causes Psychological Demise. Unfortunately, 50 % of us emotionally lifeless. These types of emotionally useless minds are much easier to brainwash. Terrorist teams hardly ever goal children dwelling in households and protected environments. Merely because these types of consumers are emotionally attached, and therefore it\'s not at all painless to brainwash them. They generally target people today who are residing on their personal. Many of the loners. Now, easy methods to counter this problem?  An historical stating goes like: “The most frustrating situation has the only treatment.” And for this relatives trouble there is a 4 letter choice named - Appreciate! Love all your family members and cherished your family members. Smile, god enjoys you, always keep smiling, the whole world will much too. <a href=\"http://samedayessay.net/\">http://www.samedayessay.net</a>  	While researching for this informative article, I appeared into most studies and formulas to suppress global terrorism.

What could be prompt? <p>Global terrorism is often quoted as <a href=\"http://gurucoursework.com/art\">gurucoursework.com/art</a> a person within the fundamental probable valid reason for Community War 3 to happen.<!--more--> It can be also described since the black face of humanity inside the twenty first Century. In my view World Terrorism is surely an unnatural method of expression of anger and in convert heat. The equation causing world terrorism can be quite relatively easy: Foods loaded with most proteins + comparatively low level of work out + Stagnant Employment = Storage of surplus warmth around the overall body.   The concern which regularly intrigues me is the fact that - one hundred ages back we ended up feeding on he equivalent food items, cooked in more or less similar way. Then why a lot extra warmth. But then I center into the latter section of the equation. Insufficient good training and stagnant positions. Roughly a 100 ages back, the doing the job design and style was sweat loaded. Now it has altered to sweat 100 % free, motion 100 % free give good results above over 7 several hours. This is actually the rationale that individuals excess warmth making proteins get gathered inside our shape. Scientifically, the human entire body accepts added heat only to the selected stage. After that the head is instantly stimulated to think of ideas for getting this needless warmth outside of the human body. Sadly, due to parental and societal pressures on youngsters and youngsters, the main gateway for this warmth gets to be violence. </p> <p>We frequently observe that parents nowadays grievance in their kids staying abusive, disrespectful in addition to bodily violent. The solution in for this problem lies in switching off the gaming <a href=\"http://www.comprarviagraes24.com/viagra-sin-receta\">viagra sin receta</a> console and sending the children Outside to perform. But how do we link this to world terrorism? Its quite effortless. Many of these “over-heated” kids oftentimes get into midnight brawls, avenue rows and stuff. In these kinds of predicaments they get their heroes - the harmful guys (For them, “the fascinating guys”). It is actually commonly reported that superior organization is the best reward you\'re able to ask for. The precise opposite of the scenario is leading to world terrorism. These modest pockets of “cool men groups” get along with the wonderful resource of social websites the Internet has provided them. These types of starts off the vicious circle of terrorist pursuits.  Extremist nations sometimes use these ultra powerful and violent groups to secretly assault their enemies. The simplest way to attack the enemy is to weaken it internally. Terrorists gradually developed into an asset into the drug mafias and agreement killer gangs. It is relatively amusing that all this may be associated with the morsel of meat that you simply may be chewing at the present time as well as your laziness to move one\'s body seven days a week! So how can we clear up this issue? Simple and easy - Improve Your Food Behaviors, Pay attention to Your Grandma, and acquire Out and Training! </p> <p>Thus the food stuff we take in is probably the leading explanations bringing about world-wide terrorism. But it is not the only good reason driving it. We need to change and transform one or two alot more tasks. The second factor which comes to my brain, is Household Values. No! I am not blaming your fathers and mothers! Neither am I blaming mine! I want to change the relatives technique during which we are living at the moment. I have a pal in Germany. She’s 38 several years previous, unmarried. She life in Berlin. Her brother lives along with his partner around the same town. Her more youthful sister is divorced two times also lives there. And guess the place their 80 year previous mom or dad reside? In BERLIN! Living separate seriously isn\'t a problem for them. It\'s always their personal decision and i concur. But my issue would be that the family satisfy only on Xmas and Thanksgiving. six customers for the similar spouse and children, residing in four diverse residences, estranged from one another. Is this what we name relatives? Around the adamant urge to stay independently, we have forgotten the sweetness of staying dependent. We have now neglected the have a passion for we get, when another person waits for us to try to eat and slumber. And thanks to this craze of dwelling independently, we give rise to the two sided sword referred to as - individualism. This individualism typically brings about burial of feelings. Even the considered household irritates us to our main. And this results in Emotional Dying. Sorry to say, 50 % of us emotionally lifeless. This sort of emotionally lifeless minds tend to be much easier to brainwash. Terrorist teams certainly not focus on kids residing in people and guarded environments. Merely because this sort of individuals are emotionally hooked up, and therefore it isn\'t painless to brainwash them. They nearly always goal families who will be living on their very own. Most of the loners. Now, easy methods to counter this problem?  An ancient stating goes like: “The most complex condition has the simplest remedy.” And for this spouse and children drawback there\'s a 4 letter option generally known as - Like! Absolutely adore your loved ones and beloved your loved ones. Smile, god enjoys you, continue to keep smiling, the globe will as well.  	While investigating for this post, I appeared into a great number of reviews and formulation to suppress international terrorism. But any time you go into the deep of it, its just Decent home-made food items & Appreciate!
